This is the homepage for PHIL 105 -- The Philosophy of Food.

Food is a central part of human life, both in its production and consumption.
Food is closely tied to the values that we hold, and the cultural identities
that we endorse (e.g. the sorts of things that we eat vs. the sorts of things
that they eat). Our choices about food, both as individuals and as a society
raise a variety of moral, political, and economic questions. Some of the
questions we shall pursue include:

- What is food? Not everything we eat we can digest. Moreover, some of the
  things we could eat and digest (such as other people), we donâ€™t. Why not?

- What are the major economic and political structures governing food
  production and comsumption in the United States and other western countries?
  How do these structures impact developing countries?

- What are the environmental and social consequences of various sorts of
  eating habits? For example, do food choices contribute to environmental
  degradation and social injustice?

- How should we treat the animals we eat? Do we have ethical obligations to
  treat them in particular ways?

- In what ways does food connect to religious and cultural identities? To what
  extent can a society legislate for or against food practices that impinge on
  such identities?
