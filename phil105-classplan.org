* Notes
These are notes to supplement student reading. Their aim is to be introductory
and to raise questions for discussion. 

* Course Outline
** Week 1 - What is food?
This week we'll talk about the content of the course and start trying to
define its subject matter -- food. What is food anyway? Is it anything we can
eat? Anything we can digest? Something else entirely? 

*** Class 1 (8/21)
- Overview of the course
- What is food? - How do we answer this question?
  - READ: Scherer, [[http://firstwefeast.com/eat/2015/04/philosophy-of-meat-bread][What is a sandwich?]]

** Week 2 - The social construction of food
This week we continue our discussion of what counts as "food". We'll look in
particular at the notion of a social kind, and relatedly, a "socially

the way in which the industrial food system produces poultry (chicken in
particular) both for consumption and egg production. We'll also start to
discuss the different moral frameworks we might use in evaluating the moral
status of animals and the issue of killing them for food.

This is *PHIL 105* -- The Philosophy of Food.

Food is a central part of human life, both in its production and consumption.
Food is closely tied to the values that we hold, and the cultural identities
that we endorse (e.g. the sorts of things that we eat vs. the sorts of things
that they eat). Our choices about food, both as individuals and as a society
raise a variety of moral, political, and economic questions. Some of the
questions we shall pursue include:

- What is food? Not everything we eat we can digest. Moreover, some of the
  things we could eat and digest (such as other people), we don’t. Why not? Is
  the concept of "food" one that is at least to some extent dependent on our
  social practices?

- What are the major economic and political structures governing food
  production and consumption in the United States and other western countries?
  How do these structures impact developing countries?

- What are the environmental and social consequences of various sorts of
  eating habits? For example, do food choices contribute to environmental
  degradation and social injustice?

- How should we treat the animals we eat? Do we have ethical obligations to
  treat them in particular ways?

- In what ways does food connect to religious and cultural identities? To what
  extent can a society legislate for or against food practices that impinge on
  such identities?

The course syllabus is available here: [[file:/materials/phil105-syllabus.pdf][PDF]] | [[file:/materials/phil105-syllabus.html][HTML]]

Much of our discussion focuses on the modern industrial food system. For
a sense of the scale of such operations you might look at this [[https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/10/09/magazine/big-food-photo-essay.html][New York Times
Magazine article]].

*** Class 2 (1/12)
**** Definition
  #+BEGIN_QUOTE
    the reason why it is important to lay out clear definitions for difficult
    or contentious concepts is that any conclusions you reach properly apply
    only to those concepts (e.g. ‘free trade’) as defined. A clear definition
    of how you will use the term thereby both helps and constrains discussion.
    [1] It helps discussion because it gives a determinate and non-ambiguous
    meaning to the term. [2] It limits discussion because it means that whatever
    you conclude does not necessarily apply to other uses of the term. As it
    turns out, much disagreement in life results from the disagreeing parties,
    without their realizing it, meaning different things by their terms.
    [@baggini2010, 32]
  #+END_QUOTE
  - Too narrow or too broad?
    - If one’s definition is too narrow or idiosyncratic, it may be that one’s findings cannot be applied as broadly as could be hoped.
    - If, on the other hand, a definition is too broad, it may lead to equally erroneous or misleading conclusions.

**** Necessary & sufficient  conditions
- Necessary conditions :: what is /required/ for something to be the case.
- Sufficient conditions :: what is /enough/ for something to be the case.
**** Group work
- Try and specify a necessary feature of X; Is there a sufficient feature?
  1. water
  2. human being
  3. funny
  4. planet
  5. person
  6. gold
  7. cool (not the temperature)
  8. bachelor
  9. president of the USA
  10. superbowl (the game)

- Give an example of a natural kind & a social kind
  - say why each is each
  - is the social kind causal or constitutive? Why?
  
**** Social Construction
- Generic social construction :: Something is a social construction in the generic sense just in case it is an intended or unintended product of a social practice.

  - Includes all artifacts, and much else besides
    - washing machines (artifact; causally constructed)
    - husband/wife (non-artifact; constitutively constructed)
    - professor (non-artifact; constitutively constructed)
      
- Causal construction :: Something is causally constructed iff social factors play a causal role in bringing it into existence or, to some substantial extent, in its being the way it is.
     
     - *Example*: social vs. biological causes in evaluating that someone is male/female

- Constitutive construction :: Something is constitutively constructed iff in defining it we must make reference to social factors.

- Discursive construction :: Something is discursively constructed just in case it is the way it is, to some substantial extent, because of what is attributed (and/or self-attributed) to it.
    
- Pragmatic construction :: A classificatory apparatus (be it a full-blown classification scheme or just a conceptual distinction or descriptive term) is socially constructed just in case its use is determined, at least in part, by social factors.
     
  - A distinction is /weakly pragmatically constructed/ if social factors only partly determine our use of it.

  - A distinction is /strongly pragmatically constructed/ if social factors wholly determine our use of it, and it fails to represent accurately any “fact of the matter.”
**** What is a "nutrient"?
- Excerpts from /Nutrition for Dummies/
    - are there nutrients that we wouldn't count as food? (sufficient conditions)
      - feces: [[http://gawker.com/5985723/can-you-eat-your-own-poop?tag=Food][Can you eat your own poop?]]
    - are there foods that aren't nutrients? (necessary conditions)
  - Food and it's image
    - [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QqQVll-MP3I][Opening to Food Inc.]]
  - Introducing the notion of a social kind

***** Nutritionism
- READ: "Nutritionism and Functional Foods", Gyorgy Scrinis
- What is "nutritionism"?
- Nutritionism :: An ideology that conceives of food purely in terms of
                  nutrients consumed for the maintenance & development of the
                  organism's bodily health
                  
- Why is nutritionism an "ideology"?

- What is wrong with nutritionism?
  1. ignores context
    - isolates nutrients from each other
    - isolates food from diet
    - isolates diet from culture/life
  2. Assumes food is only for bodily health

**** Notes
***** Natural vs. Social Kinds
- What is a "social kind"?
  - What is "social construction"?
      - Is food a social kind?
***** Cannibalism
- Cannibilism is not morally wrong
- One can legitimately consent to being eaten
  - Consent distinguishes (indirect) suicide from murder or other wrongful
    killing here

****** Objections to Cannibalism
1. Cannibalism is a kind of illness
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  Cannibalism/suicide are manifestations of mental illness. The mentally ill
  are not competent. Thus, because competence is a prerequisite for legitimate
  consent, Brandes did not consent. (16)
#+END_QUOTE

- Begs the question
  - that cannibalism is illegitimate or cannot be consented to is just what is
    up for debate

- Cannibalism will kill you
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  A popular view now seems to be that the consumption of human flesh is a
  cause of this disease [Kuru]. If this is true, it seems, we have a reason not to consume human flesh: namely, it will kill you.
#+END_QUOTE

- We consume lots of things that harm us without it being morally/legally illegitimate

3. Cannibalism is disgusting/outrageous 
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  The sense of general disgust that pervaded that population, the argument
  goes, and the moral outrage that accompanied this disgust, would far
  outweigh whatever meager culinary benefits might accrue by consuming the
  dead. (18-19)
#+END_QUOTE        

- There are lots of things that might be deemed, at a time, outrageous or
  societal harms, but conservative stance isn't itself justification

4. Cannibalism violates obligations to the dead
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  The final argument against cannibalism is an argument from obligation to the
  dead. On this view, cannibalism violates the general principle that we ought
  to respect the dead, and hence, cannibalism is morally impermissible. (19)
#+END_QUOTE

- In some cultures cannibalims is a form of respecting the dead (e.g. Fore
  people of Papua New Guinea)

   - Swift's satire: could Swift's story work if food were a natural kind?
   - Is "meat" a social kind? 
        
3. Nutritionism
   - What is nutritionism?
   - What problems are there with nutritionism?

4. Group work:
   - what are some examples of natural kinds? Of social kinds? Why? What are
     salient characteristics?

**** Assignments

  - Child obesity is the fault of irresposible parents, not the food industry
  - Adult obesity is a failure of personal responsibility
****** Government Regulation

  inteterests in increased processing and additives

**** Notes 
***** Chicken Facts
- Two kinds of poultry
  - meat (broiler chicken)
  - egg-laying (egg-laying hens)
- Chicken lifespan is roughly 7 years, but typically 1-3 for egg-layers & 6
  weeks for broilers (2-4 weeks longer for orgnic/free-range)
- Today’s egg producing hens can produce over 300 eggs per year; this is over twice the average of 150 eggs per year in 1947.
****** From the [[http://www.nationalchickencouncil.org/about-the-industry/statistics/broiler-chicken-industry-key-facts/][National Chicken Council]] on broiler chickens
- In 2015, almost 9 billion broiler chickens, weighing 53 billion pounds,
  liveweight, were produced in the USA
- The United States has the largest broiler chicken industry in the world, and about 19 percent of production was exported to other countries in 2015.
- Americans consume more chicken than anyone else in the world – more than 90
  pounds per capita in 2015 – the number one protein consumed in the United
  States.
- The top 5 broiler producing states are: Georgia, Arkansas, Alabama, North Carolina and Mississippi.
- Employs 280,800 people directly with $90 billion in total sales
***** Suffering & Cruelty 
- Cruelty results as much from indifference to pain/suffering as from the
  intentional infliction of pain/suffering
- Nature is not cruel. Cruelty requires a conception of pain/suffering in
  others and the capacity to choose not to inflict such pain.
***** Chicken slaughter
- [[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/bruce-friedrich/usda-time-to-stop-the-chi_b_4855990.html][Huffington Post]] article on boiling chickens alive

* One min exercise
This might be useful to incorporate into the weekly critical questions or quizzes

This formative assessment is typically completed by students in the last 10 minutes of class. Such papers allow students to show what they are learning in a "low stakes" non-evaluative context and enable you to know if your students are fully understanding or achieving your learning goals. Some questions might include the following:

- What is the most important (interesting) issue you learned this week?
- What course activities are helping you to learn best?
- Connect the concept of "x" that we discussed today with last week's discussion of "y."
- What is one concept addressed thus far that you don't fully understand?
- What is one question you have about course content that you'd like addressed in an upcoming class?
