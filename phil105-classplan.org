might be good or bad.

*** Writing Exercise                                                          :noexport:

- What is one thing you want to learn in this class?
- What is one food you love to eat?
- Have you ever been a part of a food production process?    

*** Definitions

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
- Necessary conditions :: what is /required/ for something to be the case.
- Sufficient conditions :: what is /enough/ for something to be the case.
- Definition :: the *necessary* and *sufficient* conditions for the application of
                a term or concept. A proper definition should specify all and
                only the things satisfying the necessary and sufficient
                conditions
                
#+BEGIN_NOTES
- nec & suff cond each give 'criteria' for kind membership
- talk about counterexamples
- often very difficult to give a fully precise definition (e.g. sandwich, chair)
#+END_NOTES

*** Natural Kinds  
- Natural Kind :: a kind that corresponds to some grouping that reflects the
                  structure of the natural world rather than the interests,
                  actions, or practices of human beings

\\
                  
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
- Examples of natural kind terms:
  - "gold"
  - "water"

#+BEGIN_NOTES 
- not all scientific definitions are "natural" - consider "planet"
  1. is in orbit around the Sun,
  2. has sufficient mass to assume hydrostatic equilibrium (a nearly round shape), and
  3. has "cleared the neighborhood" around its orbit.
- Is "sandwich" a natural kind?
- Is "food" a natural kind? Is it more like "cool" or more like "water"?
#+END_NOTES

*** "Food" Defined?

- Food :: Any substance or stuff that can provide nutritional calories
          

                
**** Food & Nutrients 
- Nutrient :: a component or element of a food stuff that an organism needs in order
              to develop and/or survive
              
#+BEGIN_NOTES
- Macronutrients :: fat, water, protein, carbohydrates
- Micronutrients :: vitamins & minerals
- "Essential nutrients" are nutrients whose lack is linked to specific
  deficiency diseases (e.g. Vitamin C & scurvy)
  - Essential nutrients are unable to be synthesized internally (either at
    all, or in sufficient quantities), and so must be consumed by an organism
    from its environment
#+END_NOTES

**** Food & Energy
- Calorie :: The amount of energy needed to raise the temperature of 1 kilogram of
             water 1 degree Celsius
            
#+BEGIN_NOTES
- A calories is a *unit measure*; calories aren't in a thing like nutrients are
- A calorie is ultimately a measure of digestable (burnable/metabolizable) energy
#+END_NOTES

**** Does 'Food' Pick out a Natural Kind?

- Food :: Any substance or stuff that can provide nutritional calories

\\
          
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
1. Does the proposed definition cover all the things we intuitively consider to /be/ food?
2. Does the proposed definition exclude all the things we intuitively think are /not/ food?

#+BEGIN_NOTES
- Talk about how we understand and analyze definitions
- Are there counterexamples? 
  - Not sufficient: feces is not (for humans) food; water & oxygen are not foodstuffs
  - Not necessary: cellulose (fiber more generally) is not a nutrient & has no
    calories (its indigestible) but is present in many foods
#+END_NOTES


*** Social Construction
- Social Construction :: Something is (at least partly) a social construction only if it is either brought into existence or specifically makes reference to "social" practices as opposed to "natural" causes or events
     
\\

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
- Examples include
  #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
  - Artifacts (e.g. washing machines, smart phones)
  - Social position (e.g. husband/wife, king/queen)
#+BEGIN_NOTES
  - Includes all artifacts, and much else besides
    - washing machines (artifact; causally constructed)
    - husband/wife (non-artifact; constitutively constructed)
    - professor (non-artifact; constitutively constructed)
  - Note that "socially constructed" doesn't mean "not real"
  - (for next week): Does "food" pick out a social construction? What about "meat"?
#+END_NOTES

*** CANCELED Causal vs. Constitutive                                          :noexport:
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
- Causal construction :: Something is causally constructed iff social factors play a causal role in bringing it into existence or, to some substantial extent, in its being the way it is.
#+BEGIN_NOTES
- *Example*: social vs. biological causes in evaluating that someone is male/female
#+END_NOTES
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
- Constitutive construction :: Something is constitutively constructed iff in defining it we must make reference to social factors.
    
#+BEGIN_NOTES
- Explain that "iff" is if and only -- i.e. necessary and sufficient
- Can something be both causally & constitutively constructed?

*** Giving Definitions
- Definition :: the *necessary* and *sufficient* conditions for the application of
                a term or concept. A proper definition should specify all and
                only the things satisfying the necessary and sufficient

#+BEGIN_NOTES
- Discuss how hard it can be to adequately define something
- Discuss counterexamples
#+END_NOTES

*** Natural & Social Kinds
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
- Natural Kind :: a kind that corresponds to some grouping that reflects the
                  structure of the natural world rather than the interests,
                  actions, or practices of human beings

\\

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
- Socially Constructed Kind :: a kind that is either brought into existence or
     specifically makes reference to "social" practices as opposed to
     "natural" causes or events
     
#+BEGIN_NOTES
- not all kinds discussed by science are "natural" (e.g. "planet")
- Socially constructed kinds include all artifacts, social roles/positions, possibly also race and gender
#+END_NOTES
*** Writing Exercise 
1. Give an example of a natural kind and a social kind
2. Name a feature for each example that you think marks it as being a
   natural kind or a social kind

#+BEGIN_NOTES

  down on whiteboard
#+END_NOTES


*** "Food" Defined?
- Food :: Any substance or stuff that can provide nutritional calories
         
\\

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Eat food. Not too much. Mostly plants.

Once, food was all you could eat, but today there are lots of other edible
foodlike substances in the supermarket (Pollan, "Unhappy Meals")
#+END_QUOTE

#+BEGIN_NOTES
- Are there counterexamples? 
  - Not sufficient: feces is not (for humans) food; water & oxygen are not foodstuffs
  - Not necessary: cellulose (fiber more generally) is not a nutrient & has no
    calories (its indigestible) but is present in many foods
- In what sense is nutritionism "ideological"?
#+END_NOTES


*** Food vs Food-Like-Substances

- Pollan's claims:
  #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
  1. We should distinguish food from other "food-like" edibles
  2. The modern western diet is mostly based on edibles that resemble, but are not actually, food
 

*** Nutritionism

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
The ﬁrst thing to understand about nutritionism...is that it is not quite the same as nutrition. As the “ism” suggests, it is not a scientiﬁc subject but an ideology. (Pollan, "Unhappy Meals")
#+END_QUOTE

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
1. What is an ideology?
2. Why is nutritionism an ideology?

*** Nutritionism as Ideology

- Ideology :: Way(s) of organizing large swaths of life and experience under a
              set of shared but unexamined assumptions
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
- Nutritionism :: An ideology that conceives of food purely in terms of nutrients consumed for the maintenance & development of the organism's bodily health

\\

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
- How could construing food as a natural kind be ideological? 

#+BEGIN_NOTES
- Compare nutritionism to capitalism or democracy
- "A reigning ideology is a little like the weather, all pervasive and virtually inescapable" Pollan, "Unhappy Meals"
#+END_NOTES

*** What is wrong with Nutritionism?
  #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
1. Oversimplifies our relationship to food
   #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
   - Ignores context (i.e. is 'reductionist')
     #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
     - isolates nutrients from each other
     - isolates food from diet
     - isolates diet from culture/life
2. Assumes food is only for bodily health
3. Ignores qualitative distinctions between foods
   #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
   - no difference between, e.g., beef, chicken, fish, or tofu, all are simply protein sources
   - treats 'processed' food as equivalent to 'unprocessed' or 'natural' food
4. Easily leads to abuse by economic/political interests
     

#+BEGIN_NOTES
- Is this criticism anti-science?
- How many of Pollan's criticisms depend on our current ignorance about food
  science & nutrition? 
#+END_NOTES

# #+BEGIN_QUOTE
#   [the assumption that food is relevant for bodily health] is not shared by
#   all cultures and...the experience of these other cultures suggests that,
#   paradoxically, viewing food as being about things other than bodily health —
#   like pleasure, say, or socializing — makes people no less healthy; indeed,
#   there’s some reason to believe that it may make them more healthy.
# #+END_QUOTE 
       
#+BEGIN_NOTES
- Cites the "French Paradox" that consumption of unhealthy foods makes a
  population more healthy
#+END_NOTES


*** Objecting to Nutritionism or to Food Science?

- Are Pollan's worries directed at /nutritionism/ or food science more generally?

#+REVEAL: split
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
If nutritional scientists know [that focusing on isolated nutrients can
produce misleading evidence], why do they do it anyway? Because a nutrient
bias is built into the way science is done: scientists need individual
variables they can isolate. Yet even the simplest food is a hopelessly complex
thing to study ... So if you’re a nutritional scientist, you do the only thing
you can do, given the tools at your disposal: break the thing down into its
component parts and study those one by one, even if that means ignoring
complex interactions and contexts, as well as the fact that the whole may be
more than, or just different from, the sum of its parts. This is what we mean
by reductionist science. 
#+END_QUOTE

#+BEGIN_NOTES
- Is this a fair way to portray the science?
- Is science hopelessly 'reductionist'?
#+END_NOTES


*** An Alternative to Nutritionism?
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
 Scientists operating with the best of intentions, using the best tools at
 their disposal, have taught us to look at food in a way that has diminished
 our pleasure in eating it while doing little or nothing to improve our
 health. Perhaps what we need now is a broader, less reductive view of what
 food is, one that is at once more ecological and cultural. What would happen,
 for example, if we were to start thinking about food as less of a thing and
 more of a relationship?
#+END_QUOTE

#+BEGIN_NOTES
- Has science really done "little or nothing" to improve our health? (e.g. FDA)
- Holist conception of food
- Food as partially defined in terms of its place in a certain kind of
  functional web
#+END_NOTES

*** "Food" as a Relational Kind

#+BEGIN_NOTES
- 'Holist' conception of food
- Food as partially defined in terms of its place in a certain kind of
  functional and social web
#+END_NOTES
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
When most of us think about food and health, we think in fairly narrow
nutritionist terms—about our personal physical health and how the ingestion of
this particular nutrient or rejection of that affects it. But I no longer
think it's possible to separate our bodily health from the health of the
environment from which we eat or the environment in which we eat or, for that
matter, from the health of our general oudook about food (and health).
(Pollan, /In Defense of Food/ p. 144)
#+END_QUOTE
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)

*** Food Holism

- Food Holism :: We should evaluate the status of a foodstuff as *food* with
                 respect to its place in a chain of social practices, production, and consumption
                 
                 
\\

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
- What distinguishes *food* from /food-like-edibles/?
  #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
  - Is the foodstuff heavily processed?
  - Is the foodstuff that is produced also /consumed/ by its producers?
  - Is the production of the foodstuff harmful to the environment?
  - Is the production of the foodstuff heavily dependent on technological intervention?


*** Escaping the Western Diet

1. Leave the (industrialized) west
2. Alter your food consumption habits

#+BEGIN_NOTES
- How do we avoid Nutritionism if it is the dominant ideology in the west?
#+END_NOTES

*** Pollan's  "Rules"
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Eat food. Not too much. Mostly plants. 
#+END_QUOTE

**** Eat Food

1. Don’t eat anything your great-great-grandmother wouldn’t recognize as food.
2. Avoid food products that come bearing health claims.
3. Avoid food products containing ingredients that are a) unfamiliar, b) unpronounceable c) more than ﬁve in number, c) contain high-fructose corn syrup
4. Get out of the supermarket whenever possible


**** Is Pollan's Proposal Realistic?

- The exhortation to "eat food" makes a number of assumptions about food consumers
  #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
  1. Have a family or cultural culinary tradition from which to draw
  2. Have the time to evaluate food lables or latest dietary science
  3. Live in areas that have decent "food culture" (e.g. farmer's markets, restaurants) rather than "food deserts"
  4. Be able to afford food rather than food-like-substances

**** Chicken Farming
- Two kinds of (industrially) farmed poultry
  #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
  - meat ("broiler" chicken)
  - egg-laying (egg-laying hens or "layers")

    
#+BEGIN_NOTES
- Chicken "natural" lifespan is roughly 7-8 years, but typically 1-3 years for
  egg-layers & 6 weeks for broilers (2-4 weeks longer for organic/free-range)
- The United States has the largest broiler chicken industry in the world, and about 19 percent of production was exported to other countries in 2015.
- Americans consume more chicken than anyone else in the world – more than 90
  pounds per capita in 2015 – the number one protein consumed in the United
  States.
- The top 5 broiler producing states are: Georgia, Arkansas, Alabama, North Carolina and Mississippi.
- Employs 280,800 people directly, and over 1.3 million indirectly, with $90 billion in total sales
#+END_NOTES

**** Egg Farms
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
- Today’s egg producing hens ("layers") can produce over 300 eggs per year; this is over twice the average of 150 eggs per year in 1947.
- Raised with relatively little space
- Often killed after peak egg production years (1-2 years)
- Between 200 & 250 million male chickens are killed each year in egg industry
  
#+BEGIN_NOTES
- Roughly 30 million chickens killed in Hy-Line Iowa plant
#+END_NOTES
  
**** Broiler Farms
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
- Broiler chickens are selected and bred for large-scale, efficient meat production
- Breeding produces "welfare" problems
  #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
  - Sudden death syndrome (acute heart failure)
  - Skeletal disfunction & lameness
  - Respiratory diseases (ammonia inhalation)

**** Broiler "Processing"
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
- Broiler chickens are stunned/paralyzed but not rendered unconscious before slaughter
- On average 825,000 chickens are boiled alive each year due to improper
  slaughter conditions

3. There are no other relevant differences between these "marginal cases" and cases of beings that possess /C/, and so possess moral status

**** Animal Rights
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
 The fundamental wrong is the system that allows us to view animals as our
 resources, here for us—to be eaten, or surgically manipulated, or put in our
 cross hairs for sport or money. (Regan, 31)

**** An Objection

- Problem: It is difficult to understand what inherent value is
  #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
  - The problem with inherent value isn't that it is mysterious, but rather
    that Regan hasn't provided a satisfactory explanation of /why/ animals
    have inherent value
  - The fact that our knowledge of which beings have inherent value is
    limited doesn't mean that we shouldn't be cautious in the manner in
    which we make life or death decisions regarding their treatment
   
#+BEGIN_NOTES
- It is difficult to understand what inherent value is
  - "It is not dependent upon the value which either the inherently valuable
    individual or anyone else may place upon that individual's life or
    experiences. It is not (necessarily) a function of sentience or any other
    mental capacity"
- Hard to identify any sharp line distinguishing those which have it from
  those that don't (doesn't "subjecthood" come in degrees?)

 it seems to me [the vegetarian] has lost something along the way,
 something I'm not prepared to dismiss as trivial. Healthy and virtuous
 as I may feel these days, I also feel alienated from traditions I
 value: cultural traditions like the Thanksgiving turkey, or even franks
 at the ballpark, and family traditions like my mother's beef brisket at
 Passover. These ritual meals link us to our history along multiple
 lines---family, religion, landscape, nation, and, if you want to go back
 much further, biology. For although humans no longer need meat in order
 to survive...we have been meat eaters for most of our time on earth.
 This fact of evolutionary history is reflected in [our physiology]. (OD, 314)

*** Defense 2: It Is Suffering Not Pain That Matters
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  human pain differs from animal pain by an order of magnitude. This
  qualitative difference is largely the result of our possession of
  language and, by virtue of language, our ability to have thoughts
  about thoughts and to imagine what is not...we can draw a distinction
  between pain, which a great many animals obviously experience, and
  suffering, which depends on a degree of self-consciousness only a
  handful of animals appear to command. Suffering in this view is not
  just lots of pain but pain amplified by distinctly human emotions such
  as regret, self-pity, shame, humiliation, and dread. (OD, 316)
#+END_QUOTE 

**** Replies
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
- While it might be true that a /certain kind/ of suffering requires
  language, it isn't obvious that /suffering/ as such does
- Cognitively unsophisticated creatures might actually suffer /more/,
  since they cannot understand the purpose of many pain-inducing
  activities
- Even allowing the distinction, industrial farming practices clearly
  generate prolonged pain that clearly goes against the interests of the
  animals produced by it

  which cognitively sophisticated animals can "enjoy" but not that

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
 We can take Pollan to be arguing that since domestic animals have
 evolved to be what they now are through their symbiotic relationship
 with humans, their "characteristic form of life"---a phrase Pollan
 borrows from Aristotle---is one lived in domestication with humans, and
 that means---for chickens, pigs, cows, and sheep---a life on a farm or
 ranch. This is their nature, and the Good Life for them is one in which
 they can live, in accordance with their nature, on the Good Farm, until
 they are killed and eaten. The killing and eating is unavoidable, for
 without it neither farms, nor the animals on them, would exist at all.
 (Singer, 250)
#+END_QUOTE

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
- Why think that bringing an animal into existence is a benefit to that
  animal, or not bringing it into existence a harm?
  #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
  - Could it be true that it would be better for an animal never to have
    lived at all?

#+BEGIN_NOTES
- The argument, then, is that eating meat from farms that give pigs good lives cannot be bad for the pigs, since if no one ate meat, these pigs would not exist. To eat them, however, we have to kill them first, so killing them must be justifiable.
#+END_NOTES

**** Singer's Objection

- Animals consumed for food live lives that are shorter than they
  would otherwise naturally be, so it is wrong to kill them, even if
  their lives are "happy"

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
 cattle, like all the animals we eat, died while still very young. They might have lived several more years before meeting one of these other forms of death, years in which they matured, experienced sexual intercourse, and, if they were females, cared for their children. We humans, after all, are prepared to pass up many rapid and humane forms of death in order to live a few more years, even if we are then likely to die of a disease that causes us to suffer before we die.
#+END_QUOTE

**** Scruton's Response to Singer
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)

  a creature capable of appreciating the goodness of future

 The grain that the vegan eats is harvested with a combine that shreds
 field mice, while the farmer's tractor wheel crushes woodchucks in
 their burrows and his pesticides drop songbirds from the sky; after
 harvest whatever animals that would eat our crops we exterminate.
 Killing animals is probably unavoidable no matter what we choose to
 eat...If our goal is to kill as few animals as possible people should
 probably try to eat the largest possible animal that can live on the
 least cultivated land: grass-finished steaks for everyone. (OD, 326)
#+END_QUOTE

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)

 Genetically modified (GM) food derives from microorganisms, plants, or

 in which “foreign” genes are inserted into the microorganisms, plants, or
 animals. Foreign genes are genes taken from sources other than the
 organism’s natural parents. In other words, genetically modified plants
 contain genes they would not have contained if researchers had only used
 traditional plant-breeding methods. (Comstock, 122)

 thought that there is anything wrong with not giving. The charitable
 man may be praised, but the man who is not charitable is not condemned.
 People do not feel in any way ashamed or guilty about spending money on
 new clothes or a new car instead of giving it to famine relief.
 (Indeed, the alternative does not occur to them.) This way of looking
 at the matter cannot be justified. When we buy new clothes not to keep
 ourselves warm but to look "well-dressed" we are not providing for any
 important need. We would not be sacrificing anything significant if we
 were to continue to wear our old clothes, and give the money to famine
 relief. By doing so, we would be preventing another person from
 starving. It follows from what I have said earlier that we ought to
 give money away, rather than spend it on clothes which we do not need
 to keep us warm. (Singer, 235)

 One objection to the position I have taken might be simply that it is
 too drastic a revision of our moral scheme. People do not ordinarily
 judge in the way I have suggested they should. Most people reserve
 their moral condemnation for those who violate some moral norm, such as
 the norm against taking another person's property. They do not condemn
 those who indulge in luxury instead of giving to famine relief.

 admitted to a rich lifeboat, or in some other way to benefit from the

The fundamental error of the sharing ethic is that it leads to the tragedy of

own property recognize their responsibility to care for it, for if they don't
they will eventually suffer. ... if a [resource] is run as a commons open to all,
the right of each to use it is not matched by an operational responsibility to
take care of it. (Hardin, /Lifeboat Ethics/ p. 88)

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
 The input of food from a food bank acts as the pawl of a ratchet,
 preventing the population from retracing its steps to a lower level.
 Reproduction pushes the population upward, inputs from the world bank
 prevent its moving downward. Population size escalates, as does the
 absolute magnitude of "accidents" and "emergencies." The process is
 brought to an end only by the total collapse of the whole system,
 producing a catastrophe of scarcely imaginable proportions. (Hardin, 90)

 The external sense of taste...with which nature has furnished us, and by

**** Kant Against An Aesthetic Appreciation of Food
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
 Kant points out that we have individual, and at times quirky, likes
 and dislikes of particular foods. We sense liking or disliking a soup,
 for instance, immediately on tasting it, and our appreciative attitude
 towards food is one of a “taste of sense.” However, our attitude
 towards things beautiful is quite different. To value something as
 beautiful, Kant thought, demanded a universal assent and should not be
 based on a personal preference. Appreciation of the beautiful calls for
 our exhibiting a disinterested attitude. Our enjoyment of things
 beautiful is not a hedonic reﬂex. It requires a taste of reﬂection, a
 sustained contemplative activity, one which engages our common
 cognitive faculties, especially our imagination, in an unrestricted
 way. (Sweeney, 122)
#+END_QUOTE

#+REVEAL: split
1. Our appreciation of food at best involves a mere taste of
   sense---i.e. mere personal preference

3. \therefore Food is not a proper object of aesthetic appreciation/criticism
   
*** Sweeney's Argument for the Aesthetic Qualitites of Food 
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
 we can answer the question “Can a soup be beautiful?” in the affirmative
 because a soup can be the object of a complex aesthetic experience that
 warrants an evaluative label like ‘beautiful.’ Unlike those who hold that
 food offers only an immediate simple pleasure, we...now recognize that
 food offers us a contemplative experience, because of the alimentary
 sequence by which it is consumed and the sensory modalities of taste and
 smell with which it is engaged. (Sweeney, 129)
#+END_QUOTE

#+REVEAL: split
1. The Kantian conception of aesthetic judgment requires that it be
   reflective/contemplative and disinterested

Mr. Pollan, not surprisingly, does worry as imports climb. “I think it would be a tremendous loss if we weren’t growing a significant percentage of our produce, for reasons having to do both with quality, and with the knowledge of the environment that farmers bring to a society,” he said. “Don’t underestimate the ritual of eating seasonally, the pleasure one can have as fruit comes into the market,” Mr. Pollan said.

*** The Elitism Issue
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
[It's messed up] telling some poor little boy that he can’t eat a 99 cent fast
food cheeseburger because it doesn’t have integrity. Telling him how easy it
is instead to save his ducketts and maybe he can have a grass-fed...burger at
the end of the month as a reward, but in the meantime get your protein from
these canned beans that you can’t actually bake because you don’t have a stove
and, even if you did, your mom works two jobs and moonlights as an Uber driver
so she doesn’t have time to heat that shit up anyway. (Chris Newman, January

# #+BEGIN_QUOTE
# By creating a perverted norm, in which everything is always everywhere and little is seasonal, we have ceased to rely upon staples: long-keeping foods like grains, beans and root vegetables, foods that provide nutrition when summer greens, fruits and vegetables aren’t readily available. We expect a steady supply of “fresh” Peruvian asparagus, Canadian tomatoes, South African apples, Dutch peppers and Mexican broccoli. Those who believe they’re entitled to eat any food any time seem to think that predominantly local agriculture is an elitist plot to “force” a more limited diet upon us. (Mark Bittman, /NYT/ November 1, 2011)

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
[the objection to localism] gets the elitism charge precisely backward. America’s current system of food production — overly centralized and industrialized, overly controlled by a handful of companies, overly reliant on monocultures, pesticides, chemical fertilizers, chemical additives, genetically modified organisms, factory farms, government subsidies and fossil fuels — is profoundly undemocratic. It is one more sign of how the few now rule the many. (Eric Schlosser, /Washington Post/ April 29, 2011)

*** Local Food Culture = Informed Food Culture
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
- Recognize that going 'local' doesn't mean that one's practices are
  necessarily "healthier" or more "just"
- Many if not most of our food choices have global ramifications
- There may be irreconcilable costs and benefits to both global and local
  approaches
- Be able to say where your food is from & who produced it
- Being informed about your food choices = having (some) control over those choices

*** Three Topics 
1. Food Politics
2. Food Security
3. Geography & Identity
*** Sample Question
- "Local" agriculture privileges geographic and cultural locality when making food consumption and production choices. Describe at least two advantages & disadvantages of "local" vs "global" agriculture. Is one form of agriculture preferable to the other? Defend your answer. 
  
#+BEGIN_NOTES
- Local Advantages:
  - Reduced distance for transport of goods means lower environmental impact
  - Supports local economies
  - Promotes the continued existence of specific cultural practices or traditions
  - Promotes a connection to a particular locale or "sense of place"
  - Promotes or maintains a "sustainable community"
- Local Disadvantages:
  - Increased cost of food
  - Increased time required for production/consumption
  - Perhaps difficult to scale (i.e. maybe not all populations can be locavores)
  - Provincial

This is *PHIL 105* -- The Philosophy of Food.

Food is a central part of human life, both in its production and consumption.
Food is closely tied to the values that we hold, and the cultural identities
that we endorse (e.g. the sorts of things that we eat vs. the sorts of things
that they eat). Our choices about food, both as individuals and as a society
raise a variety of moral, political, and economic questions. Some of the
questions we shall pursue include:

- What is food? Not everything we eat we can digest. Moreover, some of the
  things we could eat and digest (such as other people), we don’t. Why not? Is
  the concept of "food" one that is at least to some extent dependent on our
  social practices?

- What are the major economic and political structures governing food
  production and consumption in the United States and other western countries?
  How do these structures impact developing countries?

- What are the environmental and social consequences of various sorts of
  eating habits? For example, do food choices contribute to environmental
  degradation and social injustice?

- How should we treat the animals we eat? Do we have ethical obligations to
  treat them in particular ways?

- In what ways does food connect to religious and cultural identities? To what
  extent can a society legislate for or against food practices that impinge on
  such identities?

The course syllabus is available here: [[file:/materials/phil105-syllabus.pdf][PDF]] | [[file:/materials/phil105-syllabus.html][HTML]]

Much of our discussion focuses on the modern industrial food system. For
a sense of the scale of such operations you might look at this [[https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/10/09/magazine/big-food-photo-essay.html][New York Times
Magazine article]] or Gregg Segal's project [[https://www.greggsegal.com/P-Projects/Daily-Bread/1/thumbs][Daily Bread]].

*** Class 2 (1/12)
**** Definition
  #+BEGIN_QUOTE
    the reason why it is important to lay out clear definitions for difficult
    or contentious concepts is that any conclusions you reach properly apply
    only to those concepts (e.g. ‘free trade’) as defined. A clear definition
    of how you will use the term thereby both helps and constrains discussion.
    [1] It helps discussion because it gives a determinate and non-ambiguous
    meaning to the term. [2] It limits discussion because it means that whatever
    you conclude does not necessarily apply to other uses of the term. As it
    turns out, much disagreement in life results from the disagreeing parties,
    without their realizing it, meaning different things by their terms.
    [@baggini2010, 32]
  #+END_QUOTE
  - Too narrow or too broad?
    - If one’s definition is too narrow or idiosyncratic, it may be that one’s findings cannot be applied as broadly as could be hoped.
    - If, on the other hand, a definition is too broad, it may lead to equally erroneous or misleading conclusions.

**** Necessary & sufficient  conditions
- Necessary conditions :: what is /required/ for something to be the case.
- Sufficient conditions :: what is /enough/ for something to be the case.
**** Group work
- Try and specify a necessary feature of X; Is there a sufficient feature?
  1. water
  2. human being
  3. funny
  4. planet
  5. person
  6. gold
  7. cool (not the temperature)
  8. bachelor
  9. president of the USA
  10. superbowl (the game)

- Give an example of a natural kind & a social kind
  - say why each is each
  - is the social kind causal or constitutive? Why?
  
**** Social Construction
- Generic social construction :: Something is a social construction in the generic sense just in case it is an intended or unintended product of a social practice.

  - Includes all artifacts, and much else besides
    - washing machines (artifact; causally constructed)
    - husband/wife (non-artifact; constitutively constructed)
    - professor (non-artifact; constitutively constructed)
      
- Causal construction :: Something is causally constructed iff social factors play a causal role in bringing it into existence or, to some substantial extent, in its being the way it is.
     
     - *Example*: social vs. biological causes in evaluating that someone is male/female

- Constitutive construction :: Something is constitutively constructed iff in defining it we must make reference to social factors.

- Discursive construction :: Something is discursively constructed just in case it is the way it is, to some substantial extent, because of what is attributed (and/or self-attributed) to it.
    
- Pragmatic construction :: A classificatory apparatus (be it a full-blown classification scheme or just a conceptual distinction or descriptive term) is socially constructed just in case its use is determined, at least in part, by social factors.
     
  - A distinction is /weakly pragmatically constructed/ if social factors only partly determine our use of it.

  - A distinction is /strongly pragmatically constructed/ if social factors wholly determine our use of it, and it fails to represent accurately any “fact of the matter.”
**** What is a "nutrient"?
- Excerpts from /Nutrition for Dummies/
    - are there nutrients that we wouldn't count as food? (sufficient conditions)
      - feces: [[http://gawker.com/5985723/can-you-eat-your-own-poop?tag=Food][Can you eat your own poop?]]

                  nutrients consumed for the maintenance & development of the
                  organism's bodily health
                  
- Why is nutritionism an "ideology"?

- What is wrong with nutritionism?
  1. ignores context
    - isolates nutrients from each other

  2. Assumes food is only for bodily health

**** Notes
***** Natural vs. Social Kinds
- What is a "social kind"?
  - What is "social construction"?
      - Is food a social kind?
***** Cannibalism
- Cannibilism is not morally wrong
- One can legitimately consent to being eaten
  - Consent distinguishes (indirect) suicide from murder or other wrongful
    killing here

****** Objections to Cannibalism
1. Cannibalism is a kind of illness
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  Cannibalism/suicide are manifestations of mental illness. The mentally ill
  are not competent. Thus, because competence is a prerequisite for legitimate
  consent, Brandes did not consent. (16)
#+END_QUOTE

- Begs the question
  - that cannibalism is illegitimate or cannot be consented to is just what is
    up for debate

- Cannibalism will kill you
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  A popular view now seems to be that the consumption of human flesh is a
  cause of this disease [Kuru]. If this is true, it seems, we have a reason not to consume human flesh: namely, it will kill you.
#+END_QUOTE

- We consume lots of things that harm us without it being morally/legally illegitimate

3. Cannibalism is disgusting/outrageous 
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  The sense of general disgust that pervaded that population, the argument
  goes, and the moral outrage that accompanied this disgust, would far
  outweigh whatever meager culinary benefits might accrue by consuming the
  dead. (18-19)
#+END_QUOTE        

- There are lots of things that might be deemed, at a time, outrageous or
  societal harms, but conservative stance isn't itself justification

4. Cannibalism violates obligations to the dead
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  The final argument against cannibalism is an argument from obligation to the
  dead. On this view, cannibalism violates the general principle that we ought
  to respect the dead, and hence, cannibalism is morally impermissible. (19)
#+END_QUOTE

- In some cultures cannibalims is a form of respecting the dead (e.g. Fore
  people of Papua New Guinea)

   - Swift's satire: could Swift's story work if food were a natural kind?
   - Is "meat" a social kind? 
        
3. Nutritionism
   - What is nutritionism?
   - What problems are there with nutritionism?

4. Group work:
   - what are some examples of natural kinds? Of social kinds? Why? What are
     salient characteristics?

- Industry favors increased exercise 
   - But exercise is actually staying pretty stable
****** Eating habits
- People are eating more since the 1980s
- 1900 calories per person to 2100 calories per person 
****** How to change eating habits?  
- Eating less by regulating food sizes (e.g capping soda at 16 oz)
- Eat less via assumption of responsibility
  - Child obesity is the fault of irresposible parents, not the food industry
  - Adult obesity is a failure of personal responsibility
****** Government Regulation 
- Government recommendations for less processed food and more fruits/vegetables
****** Nutritionism
- Nutritionism as reductive focus on single nutrients that aids food industry
  inteterests in increased processing and additives
- Dietary guidelines as expressing tension between focus on foods and focus on
  nutrients
****** Dilemma facing food industry
- Public health interests in reducing junk food
- Wall street investor interest in increasing ROI as much and as quickly as possible
  
******* Counting calories
- How many more calories in a 64oz soda than in an 8oz soda?
  - There are 8x the calories (about 800)
    - First year nutrition students thought it was *impossible* that soda could have 800 calories 
******* Advertising added nutrients
- junk foods that are "healthy"
- "functional foods" :: foods that possess features other than those of normal nutrients that are supposed to improve health
  - functional foods increase food sales
  - functional foods can often advertise health benefits that aren't proven & encourage views of low-calorie status of what are really high-calorie foods 
  - treat processed foods as "health foods"
******* Promoting a food environment where it is ok to eat more than is necessary or healthy

**** Notes 
***** Chicken Facts
- Two kinds of poultry
  - meat (broiler chicken)
  - egg-laying (egg-laying hens)
- Chicken lifespan is roughly 7 years, but typically 1-3 for egg-layers & 6
  weeks for broilers (2-4 weeks longer for orgnic/free-range)
- Today’s egg producing hens can produce over 300 eggs per year; this is over twice the average of 150 eggs per year in 1947.
****** From the [[http://www.nationalchickencouncil.org/about-the-industry/statistics/broiler-chicken-industry-key-facts/][National Chicken Council]] on broiler chickens
- In 2015, almost 9 billion broiler chickens, weighing 53 billion pounds,
  liveweight, were produced in the USA
- The United States has the largest broiler chicken industry in the world, and about 19 percent of production was exported to other countries in 2015.
- Americans consume more chicken than anyone else in the world – more than 90
  pounds per capita in 2015 – the number one protein consumed in the United
  States.
- The top 5 broiler producing states are: Georgia, Arkansas, Alabama, North Carolina and Mississippi.
- Employs 280,800 people directly with $90 billion in total sales
***** Suffering & Cruelty 
- Cruelty results as much from indifference to pain/suffering as from the
  intentional infliction of pain/suffering
- Nature is not cruel. Cruelty requires a conception of pain/suffering in
  others and the capacity to choose not to inflict such pain.
