<blockquote  class="fragment (appear)">
<p>
Metaphorically, each rich nation amounts to a lifeboat full of
comparatively rich people. The poor of the world are in other, much more
crowded lifeboats. Continuously, so to speak, the poor fall out of their
lifeboats and swim for a while in the water outside, hoping to be
admitted to a rich lifeboat, or in some other way to benefit from the
"goodies" on board. What should the passengers on a rich lifeboat do?
This is the central problem of "the ethics of a lifeboat." (Hardin, 86)

<dt class="fragment appear">Tragedy of the Commons:</dt><dd class="fragment appear">the economic theory concerning behavior
within a shared-resource system (i.e. "the commons") where individual
users acting independently and according to their own self-interest
behave contrary to the common good of all users by depleting or
spoiling that resource through their collective action</dd>

<ul>
<li>The basic idea is that free &amp; unrestricted use of a finite resource
ultimately exhausts that resource (either temporarily or permanently) via
over-exploitation</li>

then by Garrett Hardin in 1968</li>

<h3 id="orgc8cdc0a">The Ratchet Effect</h3>
<blockquote  class="fragment (appear)">
<p>
The input of food from a food bank acts as the pawl of a ratchet,
preventing the population from retracing its steps to a lower level.
Reproduction pushes the population upward, inputs from the world bank
prevent its moving downward. Population size escalates, as does the
absolute magnitude of "accidents" and "emergencies." The process is
brought to an end only by the total collapse of the whole system,
producing a catastrophe of scarcely imaginable proportions. (Hardin, 90)

<ul>
<li class="fragment appear">Lifeboats don't necessary interact much, but countries (and their
citizens) do all the time and the interaction is not one-sided</li>

political and economic instability</li>

<h4 id="org51c4cc6">The Commons</h4>
<blockquote  class="fragment (appear)">
<p>
Prosperity in the system of the commons cannot survive errors. If
everyone would only restrain himself, all would be well; but it takes
only one less than everyone to ruin a system of voluntary restraint. In
a crowded world of less than petfect human beings-and we will never
know any other-mutual ruin is inevitable in the commons. This is the
core of the tragedy of the commons. (Garrett, 88)

<li class="fragment appear">Garrett's view assumes that activity in a commons cannot be regulated,
but gives no argument as to why we should agree with this</li>

<h4 id="org12dc4b0">Food &amp; Population</h4>
<ul>
<li class="fragment appear">Hardin assumes that an increase in food security entails an increase
in population</li>
<li class="fragment appear">But population increases depends on a variety of factors:</li>

</ul>

<blockquote  class="fragment (appear)">
<p>
[Population increase depends on] parental confidence about the future, an
improved status of women, and literacy. [Population increases] require low
infant mortality rates, widely available rudimentary health care, increased
income and employment, and an adequate diet above subsistence levels (Murdoch
&amp; Oates, 564)
