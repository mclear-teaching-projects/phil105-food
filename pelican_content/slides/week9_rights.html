<blockquote nil>
<p>
some people believe that we have no duties directly to animals—that we owe
nothing to them—that we can do nothing that wrongs them. Rather, we can do
wrong acts that involve animals, and so we have duties regarding them, though
none to them. Such views may be called indirect duty views. (Regan, 32)

<h3 id="org0bffbfd">Animal Rights</h3>
<blockquote nil>
<p>
The fundamental wrong is the system that allows us to view animals as our
resources, here for us—to be eaten, or surgically manipulated, or put in our
cross hairs for sport or money. (Regan, 31)
</p>

<li class="fragment appear">Animals lack moral status, and so cannot be the direct or independent
objects of moral consideration [indirect duty view]</li>
<li class="fragment appear">Animals lack moral status because they are unable to <i>F</i> (e.g. unable to act rationally)</li>
<li class="fragment appear">But there are cases of beings of the kind that possesses moral status (e.g.
human beings) that are unable to <i>F</i> (e.g. children, mentally disabled)</li>
<li class="fragment appear">There are no other relevant differences between these marginal cases and animals</li>
<li class="fragment appear">Since we can't treat children or the disabled like things, we can't treat
animals like things either &#x2013; i.e. animals have moral status</li>

<blockquote  class="fragment (appear)">
<p>
Here is an analogy to help make the philosophical point clearer: a cup
contains different liquids—sometimes sweet, sometimes bitter, sometimes a mix
of the two. What has value are the liquids: the sweeter the better, the
bitter the worse. The cup—the container—has no value. It’s what goes into
it, not what they go into, that has value. For the utilitarian, you and I are
like the cup; we have no value as individuals and thus no equal value. What
has value is what goes into us, what we serve as receptacles for; our
feelings of satisfaction have positive value, our feelings of frustration
have negative value. (Regan, 35)

<h3 id="org22963fc">The Rights View</h3>
<blockquote nil>
<p>
you and I, for example, do have value as individuals—what we’ll call
<i>inherent value</i> &#x2026; My value as an individual is independent of my
usefulness to you. Yours is not dependent on your usefulness to me. For
either of us to treat the other in ways that fail to show respect for the
other’s independent value is to act immorally—is to violate the individual’s
rights. (Regan, 36)

<li class="fragment appear">What does it take to have value as an individual&#x2014;to have rights?
<ul>
<li class="fragment appear">Inherent value belongs equally to any who are the "experiencing subjects
of a life" (Regan, 37)</li>
<li class="fragment appear">At least some animals are such experiencing subjects, so at least some
animals have rights&#x2014;they cannot be used merely as means to another's ends</li>

<blockquote nil>
<p>
(1) it [Regan's animal rights theory] rests upon the obscure concept of
inherent value, which is defined only in negative terms, and (2) it seems to
preclude any plausible answer to questions about the moral status of the
vast majority of sentient animals
</p>

<ul>
<li>It is difficult to understand what inherent value is
<ul>
<li>"It is not dependent upon the value which either the inherently valuable
individual or anyone else may place upon that individual's life or
experiences. It is not (necessarily) a function of sentience or any other
mental capacity"</li>

those that don't (doesn't "subjecthood" come in degrees?)</li>

<h3 id="org0a02152">Replies to Warren</h3>
<ul>
<li class="fragment appear">The problem with inherent value isn't that it is mysterious, but rather
that Regan hasn't provided a satisfactory explanation of <i>why</i> animals
have inherent value</li>
<li class="fragment appear">The fact that our knowledge of which beings have inherent value is
limited doesn't mean that we shouldn't be cautious in the manner in
which we make life or death decisions regarding their treatment</li>
