------

Last week we discussed a moral framework called "deontology" and one of its
more famous formulations in the work of German philosopher Immanuel Kant. This
week we look at an application of the deontological theory to animals in a way
that Kant would not obviously have endorsed. This is the notion of animal
rights. We'll then go on (on Thursday) to look at whether there is a
straightforward and successful moral argument to be vegetarian.

You can see some discussion of current work for animal rights [[https://www.nonhumanrights.org][here]] and
discussion of a current project devoted to fighting for the legal rights of
chimpanzees [[http://dailynous.com/2018/03/05/philosophers-help-fight-chimpanzee-personhood/][here]]. 

You can find the slides discussing Regan's position [[file:{filename}/slides/week9_rights.pdf][here]].

The slides discussing the basic argument for moral vegetarianism are [[file:{filename}/slides/week9_basic_argument.pdf][here]].
