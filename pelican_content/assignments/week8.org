This week we begin discussion of an alternative moral framework from that of
Consequentialism called "Deontology". Deontological moral theories construe
the goodness of moral acts in terms of their adherence to strict moral
principles or laws. 

You can find today's slides [[file:{filename}/slides/week8_deontology.pdf][here]]. 


** Class 14 (2/27)

- READ: Korsgaard, "[[file:{filename}/readings/korsgaard_animals.pdf][Interacting with animals]]", especially §§4-9
- RECOMMENDED: Rachels, [[file:{filename}/readings/rachels_deontology.pdf][chs. 9-10]]

** Class 15 (2/29)
- WATCH: [[http://www.wi-phi.com/video/moral-status][Moral Status]]
- WATCH: [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Go45PUjtL8][Chignell on Kant's "Non-Consequentialism"]]

** Reading Questions
- What does it mean to have "moral status"?
- What does Kant argue has (or is the source of) ultimate or intrinsic value?
- What is it, on Kant's view, to value someone "as a mere means" rather than "as
  an end"?
- In what sense might Kant allow that animals have rights?
