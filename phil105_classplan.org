*** Definition
  #+BEGIN_QUOTE
    the reason why it is important to lay out clear definitions for difficult
    or contentious concepts is that any conclusions you reach properly apply
    only to those concepts (e.g. ‘free trade’) as defined. A clear definition
    of how you will use the term thereby both helps and constrains discussion.
    [1] It helps discussion because it gives a determinate and non-ambiguous
    meaning to the term. [2] It limits discussion because it means that whatever
    you conclude does not necessarily apply to other uses of the term. As it
    turns out, much disagreement in life results from the disagreeing parties,
    without their realizing it, meaning different things by their terms.

  #+END_QUOTE
  - Too narrow or too broad?
    - If one’s definition is too narrow or idiosyncratic, it may be that one’s findings cannot be applied as broadly as could be hoped.
    - If, on the other hand, a definition is too broad, it may lead to equally erroneous or misleading conclusions.
