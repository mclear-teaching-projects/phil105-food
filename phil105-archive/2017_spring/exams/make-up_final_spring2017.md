# Argument Identification (20 points)

*Pick **two passages**. Identify (i) the main point of the passage; (ii) the
evidence or argument that supports this point*

1. 
    >human pain differs from animal pain by an order of magnitude. This
    >qualitative difference is largely the result of our possession of language
    >and, by virtue of language, our ability to have thoughts about thoughts
    >and to imagine what is not...we can draw a distinction between pain, which
    >a great many animals obviously experience, and suffering, which depends on
    >a degree of self-consciousness only a handful of animals appear to
    >command. Suffering in this view is not just lots of pain but pain
    >amplified by distinctly human emotions such as regret, self-pity, shame,
    >humiliation, and dread.
    
2. 

    > In our extended reflective experience with what we ingest, we do not
    > simply experience a sum of sensed qualities. Instead, in the temporal
    > sequence of our gustatory experience, we imaginatively shape the
    > character and overall structure of what we taste: we recall and
    > imaginatively compare the ï¬‚avors that we encounter at different stages
    > of the process, note complementary and contrasting qualities, and come
    > to realize how these qualities form unities and other regional
    > structures. There are also stylistic and expressive features that we
    > come to experience.

3. 

    > It is curious that, even though the cost of a ticket to the opera or to a
    > rock concert or a Broadway play is considerably more than a dinner at most
    > upscale restaurants, the attitudes toward concert-going music lovers are
    > rarely as disapproving as those toward foodies. Indeed, many people who
    > feel morally uncomfortable spending $50 or $100 for a meal, buy such
    > tickets themselves; they drive Volvos rather than Subarus or Hondas; they
    > own large flat-screen TVs. There is no reason to think that the amount of
    > money the typical foodie spends in the service of her foodieism, then, is
    > especially large, relative to other middle- and upper-class indulgences.
    > That it should be more likely to arouse moral criticism needs to be
    > explained in other ways.

# Short Essay (30 points)

*Answer only **two** of the three*

   this principle to argue for famine relief? What objections might we raise
   for this argument? How might Singer respond in defense of the argument?
   
2. Explain what a genetically modified food is and Comstock's division of
   objections to it between intrinsic and extrinsic objections. Then explain
   the "unnaturalness objection". Discuss at least one reason why one might
   consider GM food unnatural. Discuss at least one problem with this
   reasoning.

3. Explain the difference between Kant's conception of the "taste of sense"
   and that of a "taste of reflection". Why does Kant think that food is not a
   proper object of aesthetic judgment? What is Sweeney's counterargument?
