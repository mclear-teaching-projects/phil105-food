# Short Essay (30 points)

1. PPBO & Singer

The Principle of Preventing Bad Occurences:
:   if it is in our power to prevent something bad from happening,
    without thereby sacrificing anything of comparable moral importance,
    we ought, morally, to do it. (Singer, 231)

PPBO is not affected by distance or numbers. We might worry that the principle
is too demanding & erases distinction between moral requirements and
supererogatory actions. One response would be to slightly weaken our
interpretation of the principle so that we need not worry about 'comparable'
sacrifice. 

2. GM Foods & Unnaturalness

GM Foods:
:  Food with foreign genetic material 

UE:
:   It is unnatural to genetically engineer plants, animals, and foods

    - playing god
    - inventing world-changing tech
    - illegitimately cross species boundaries 
    - commodify life 

3. Kant on food aesthetics 

Taste of sense:
:   immediate and subjective (pleasurable or displeasurable) impression
    of some thing

Taste of reflection:
:   contemplative enjoyment of something independent of whether it
    causes a pleasurable/displeasurable feeling in oneself---i.e. one
    has a *disinterested* enjoyment of the thing

Food is something about which we make merely judgments of what is agreeable.
It isn't complex enough in the experience of it to warrant reflection. 

1. Our appreciation of food at best involves a mere taste of
   sense---i.e. mere personal preference
2. Appreciation of aesthetic properties requires a taste of
   reflection---i.e. taking a disinterested pleasure in something and
   thinking that others should do so as well
3. $\therefore$ Food is not a proper object of aesthetic appreciation/criticism

- Sweeney's argument:

> we can answer the question “Can a soup be beautiful?” in the
> affirmative because a soup can be the object of a complex aesthetic
> experience that warrants an evaluative label like ‘beautiful.’ Unlike
> those who hold that food offers only an immediate simple pleasure,
> we...now recognize that food offers us a contemplative experience,
> because of the alimentary sequence by which it is consumed and the
> sensory modalities of taste and smell with which it is engaged.
> (Sweeney, 129)

1.  The Kantian conception of aesthetic judgment requires that it be
    reflective/contemplative and disinterested
2.  Alimentary experience is sufficiently complex as to allow for
    reflective and disinterested judgment
3.  $\therefore$ Food, as the object of such experience, can be a genuine object of
    aesthetic appreciation
