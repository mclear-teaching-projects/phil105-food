# Short Essay (30 points)

*Answer only two of the four*

1. Explain the "argument from marginal cases". What is a "marginal case"? What
   problem does the argument from marginal cases present?
   
    1. Animals lack moral status, and so cannot be the direct or independent
       objects of moral consideration [indirect duty view]
    2. Animals lack moral status because they are unable to /F/ (e.g. unable
       to act rationally)
    3. But there are cases of beings of the kind that possesses moral status (e.g.
       human beings) that are unable to /F/ (e.g. children, mentally disabled)
    4. There are no other relevant differences between these marginal cases
       and animals
    5. Since we can't treat children or the disabled like things, we can't treat
       animals like things either -- i.e. animals have moral status
    6. $\therefore$ We have direct duties towards animals

   
2. Explain the difficulty in giving a precise definition of the concept of
   *food*. Make sure you (i) articulate what is required to give a definition
   of a concept; (ii) describe the reasons why there might be more than one
   way to define the concept of food
     (i) provide necessary and sufficient conditions  
     (ii) food as vehicle for nutritional categories, vs. food as social kind
   
3. What is "moral hazard"? Why might the structure of our food industry
   present an instance of moral hazard?
    **Moral Hazard**
:   One party engages in "risky" actions at least in part due to the
    knowledge that some other party bears the cost of those risks. This
    typically arises when one or both of the parties possesses
    incomplete information about the other ("information asymmetry").

   The business model of the food industry requires making people think they
   either need to (i) eat more calories than is healthy; (ii) buy increasingly
   processed foods

4. What is the "basic argument" for vegetarianism? What are the limitations of
   this argument? How might one object to the argument?

    1. It is wrong to cause pain without a morally good reason.
    2. If it is wrong to cause pain without a morally good reason, then it is
       also wrong to support practices that cause pain without a morally good
       reason.
    3. If we can nourish ourselves without eating meat, then nourishment is
       not a morally good reason to cause pain to animals or to support
       practices that cause pain to animals.
    4. We can nourish ourselves without eating meat.
    5. $\therefore$ Nourishment is not a morally good reason to cause pain to
       animals or to support practices that cause pain to animals (from 3,4)
    6. $\therefore$ It is wrong to eat meat (from 1â€“2, 5)
