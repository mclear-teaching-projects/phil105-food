# Argument Identification (20 points)

*Pick **two passages**. Identify (i) the main point of the passage; (ii) the
evidence or argument that supports this point*

1. 
    > The sort of equality we find in utilitarianism, however, is not the sort
    >  an advocate of animal or human rights should have in mind.
    >  Utilitarianism has no room for the equal moral rights of different
    >  individuals because it has no room for their equal inherent value or
    >  worth...Here is an analogy to help make the philosophical point
    >  clearer: a cup contains different liquids—sometimes sweet, sometimes
    >  bitter, sometimes a mix of the two. What has value are the liquids: the
    >  sweeter the better, the bitter the worse. The cup—the container—has no
    >  value. It’s what goes into it, not what they go into, that has value.
    >  For the utilitarian, you and I are like the cup; we have no value as
    >  individuals and thus no equal value. What has value is what goes into
    >  us, what we serve as receptacles for; our feelings of satisfaction have
    >  positive value, our feelings of frustration have negative value.

2. 
    > if I did not buy and consume factory-raised meat, no animals would be
    >  spared lives of misery. Agribusiness is much too large to respond to
    >  the behavior of one consumer. Therefore I cannot prevent the suffering
    >  of any animals. I may well regret the suffering inflicted on animals
    >  for the sake of human enjoyment. I may even agree that the human
    >  enjoyment doesn’t justify the suffering. However, since the animals
    >  will suffer no matter what I do, I may as well enjoy the taste of their
    >  flesh. 
    
    
3.
    > It is probably impossible to either prove or disprove the thesis that
    > animals have moral rights by producing an analysis of the concept of a
    > moral right and checking to see if some or all animals satisfy the
    > conditions for having rights. The concept of a moral right is complex,
    > and it is not clear which of its strands are essential. Paradigm rights
    > holders, i.e., mature and mentally competent persons, are both rational
    > and morally autonomous beings and sentient subjects-of-a-life. Opponents
    > of animal rights claim that rationality and moral autonomy are essential
    > for the possession of rights, while defenders of animal rights claim
    > that they are not. The ordinary concept of a moral right is probably not
    > precise enough to enable us to determine who is right on purely
    > definitional grounds.
