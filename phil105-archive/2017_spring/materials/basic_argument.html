<h3 id="org63ecacf">Hsiao's Defense of Eating Meat</h3>
<blockquote nil>
<p>
Since the interests of animals are not moral interests, it is not morally
wrong for us to use them for the sake of providing food for us. Since
nutrition is one of our welfare interests, and eating meat is one way of
meeting that interest, then our wanting to eat meat is a sufﬁcient reason to
use animals for that purpose. Since moral welfare interests take precedent
over non-moral welfare interests, it is permissible to eat meat even if
eating meat is not necessary to meet the end of nutrition. (Hsiao, 290)
