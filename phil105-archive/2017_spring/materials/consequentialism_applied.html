<blockquote nil>
<p>
Fred explains that he keeps the puppies for twenty-six weeks, and then
butchers them while holding them upside-down. During their lives he performs
a series of mutilations on them, such as slicing off their noses and their
paws with a hot knife, all without any form of anesthesia&#x2026;

<blockquote nil>
<p>
Six months of intense puppy suffering, followed by a brutal death, produced
enough cocoamone to last Fred a week, hence the twenty-six cages. He isn’t a
sadist or an animal abuser, he explains. If there were a method of collecting
cocoamone without torturing puppies, he would gladly employ it. He derives no
pleasure from the suffering of the puppies itself. He sympathizes with those
who are horrified by the pain and misery of the animals, but the court must
realize that human pleasure is at stake. The puppies, while undeniably cute,
are mere animals. He admits that he would be just as healthy without
chocolate, if not more so. But this isn’t a matter of survival or health. His
life would be unacceptably impoverished without the experience of
chocolate. (Norcross, 230)

If we are prepared to condemn Fred for torturing puppies merely to enhance

<p>
if I did not buy and consume factory-raised meat, no animals would be spared
lives of misery. Agribusiness is much too large to respond to the behavior of
one consumer. Therefore I cannot prevent the suffering of any animals. I may
well regret the suffering inflicted on animals for the sake of human
enjoyment. I may even agree that the human enjoyment doesn’t justify the
suffering. However, since the animals will suffer no matter what I do, I may
as well enjoy the taste of their flesh. (Norcross, 231)

<p>
Fred acts impermissibly, according to this line of argument, because he
intends the suffering of the puppies as a means to his pleasure. Most meat
eaters, on the other hand, even if aware of the suffering of the animals, do
not intend the suffering. (Norcross, 234)

<ul>
<li>Concerning (2) Fred's story is easily modified to render the puppies’ suffering ‘merely’ foreseen. For example, suppose that the cocoamone is produced by a chemical reaction that can only occur when large quantities of drain-cleaner are forced down the throat of a conscious, unanaesthetized puppy. The consequent appalling suffering, while not itself a means to the production of cocoamone, is nonetheless an unavoidable side-effect of the means. In this variation of the story, Fred’s behavior is no less abominable than in the original.</li>

<p>
Fred's behavior is abominable&#x2026;because it involves the suffering of <i>puppies</i>.
The behaviour of meat eaters, on the other hand, 'merely' involves the
suffering of chickens, pigs, cows, calves, sheep, and the like. Puppies&#x2026;are
morally different from the other animals. Puppies <i>count</i> (morally that is)
whereas the other animals don't, or at least not nearly as much. (Norcross, 234)
