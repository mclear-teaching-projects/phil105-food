<blockquote nil>
<p>
To one degree or another, the question of what to have for dinner assails
every omnivore, and always has. When you can eat just about anything nature
has to offer, deciding what you <i>should</i> eat will inevitably stir anxiety,
especially when some of the potential foods on offer are liable to sicken or
kill you. (p. 3)

<blockquote nil>
<p>
Perhaps what we need now is a broader, less reductive view of what
food is, one that is at once more ecological and cultural. What would happen,
for example, if we were to start thinking about food as less of a thing and
more of a relationship?
