<p>
it seems to me [the vegetarian] has lost something along the way,
something I'm not prepared to dismiss as trivial. Healthy and virtuous
as I may feel these days, I also feel alienated from traditions I
value: cultural traditions like the Thanksgiving turkey, or even franks
at the ballpark, and family traditions like my mother's beef brisket at
Passover. These ritual meals link us to our history along multiple
lines&#x2014;family, religion, landscape, nation, and, if you want to go back
much further, biology. For although humans no longer need meat in order
to survive&#x2026;we have been meat eaters for most of our time on earth.
This fact of evolutionary history is reflected in [our physiology]. (OD, 314)

<blockquote  class="fragment (appear)">
<p>
human pain differs from animal pain by an order of magnitude. This
qualitative difference is largely the result of our possession of
language and, by virtue of language, our ability to have thoughts
about thoughts and to imagine what is not&#x2026;we can draw a distinction
between pain, which a great many animals obviously experience, and
suffering, which depends on a degree of self-consciousness only a
handful of animals appear to command. Suffering in this view is not
just lots of pain but pain amplified by distinctly human emotions such
as regret, self-pity, shame, humiliation, and dread. (OD, 316)

animals produced by it</li>

<blockquote  class="fragment (appear)">
<p>
We can take Pollan to be arguing that since domestic animals have
evolved to be what they now are through their symbiotic relationship
with humans, their "characteristic form of life"&#x2014;a phrase Pollan
borrows from Aristotle&#x2014;is one lived in domestication with humans, and
that means&#x2014;for chickens, pigs, cows, and sheep&#x2014;a life on a farm or
ranch. This is their nature, and the Good Life for them is one in which
they can live, in accordance with their nature, on the Good Farm, until
they are killed and eaten. The killing and eating is unavoidable, for
without it neither farms, nor the animals on them, would exist at all.
(Singer, 250)

<li>The argument, then, is that eating meat from farms that give pigs good lives cannot be bad for the pigs, since if no one ate meat, these pigs would not exist. To eat them, however, we have to kill them first, so killing them must be justifiable.</li>

cattle, like all the animals we eat, died while still very young. They might have lived several more years before meeting one of these other forms of death, years in which they matured, experienced sexual intercourse, and, if they were females, cared for their children. We humans, after all, are prepared to pass up many rapid and humane forms of death in order to live a few more years, even if we are then likely to die of a disease that causes us to suffer before we die.

The grain that the vegan eats is harvested with a combine that shreds
field mice, while the farmer's tractor wheel crushes woodchucks in
their burrows and his pesticides drop songbirds from the sky; after
harvest whatever animals that would eat our crops we exterminate.
Killing animals is probably unavoidable no matter what we choose to
eat&#x2026;If our goal is to kill as few animals as possible people should
probably try to eat the largest possible animal that can live on the
least cultivated land: grass-finished steaks for everyone. (OD, 326)
