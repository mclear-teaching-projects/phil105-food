# Definitions (20 points)

*Pick **four** of the five and provide the definition*

1.  Agrarianism: a social philosophy which sees farming as a way of life,
                 valuable not only for the food and agriculture it produces,
                 but also in itself.

2.  Necessary condition: what is *required* for something to be the case.

3.  Localism: privileging of a region or people's cultural traditions,
    beliefs, and aspirations over those of other regions

4.  Deontology: The rightness/wrongness of an action depends on whether the
    action is in accordance with moral principles or laws.

5.  GM Food: food created from microorganisms, plants, or animals manipulated

# Short Essay (30 points)

*Answer only **two** of the three*

1. PPBO & Singer

The Principle of Preventing Bad Occurences:
:   if it is in our power to prevent something bad from happening,
    without thereby sacrificing anything of comparable moral importance,
    we ought, morally, to do it. (Singer, 231)

PPBO is not affected by distance or numbers. We might worry that the principle
is too demanding & erases distinction between moral requirements and
supererogatory actions. One response would be to slightly weaken our
interpretation of the principle so that we need not worry about 'comparable'
sacrifice. 

2. GM Foods & Unnaturalness

GM Foods:
: is manipulated at the molecular level to have traits that farmers or
   consumers desire, and which typically contains genetically foreign material

UE:
:   It is unnatural to genetically engineer plants, animals, and foods

    - playing god
    - inventing world-changing tech
    - illegitimately cross species boundaries 
    - commodify life 

3. Functional Foods & Market Forces

Functional Food:
:   a food-based product that provides a demonstrable physiological
    benefit beyond its dietary or nutritional value.
-  It is in the interest of the food market to make us eat more than we
    need
-  It is in the interest of the food market to fortify or otherwise
    process food to add value for which it can charge higher prices
    -   fortified OJ, rice, etc.
    -   markets and the interests of public health are compatible so
        long as no greater harms are inflicted, capacities diminished,
        or rights abused
-  Market mechanisms are "fickle"
    -   markets are not designed to solve health problems
        -   the interests of the market do not coincide with public
            health interests

> commercial interests have the potential to transform how we eat and
> how we care for ourselves, yet the very future of food is in the hands
> of those who may not have our best interests in mind. That may be the
> most important thing wrong with functional foods. (Kaplan, 185)
