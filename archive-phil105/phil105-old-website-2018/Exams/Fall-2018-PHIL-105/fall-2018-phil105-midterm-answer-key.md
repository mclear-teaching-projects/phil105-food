   and do so without demonstrating a failure to grasp what a right is, etc.

# Short Essay

1. Explain the "argument from marginal cases". What is a "marginal case"? What
   problem does the argument from marginal cases present?
   
    > 1.  Creatures that lack moral status lack it because they lack some
    >     characteristic *C* (e.g. rationality or intelligence)
    > 2.  But there are cases of beings that possess moral status (e.g. human
    >     beings) while otherwise lacking characteristic *C* (e.g. children,
    >     mentally disabled, people in persistent vegetative states)
    > 3.  There are no other relevant differences between these "*marginal
    >     cases*" and cases of beings that possess *C*, and so possess moral
    >     status
    > 4.  Therefore, whatever confers moral status must be a characteristic
    >     that is had by *all* cases, including the "*marginal*" ones,
    >     anything else is *arbitrary*

    All are cases where there is an absence of C but presence of moral status.
    Demonstrates the challenge of providing a universal definition of what
    constitutes moral status 

2. Explain the difficulty in giving a precise definition of the concept of
   *food*. Make sure you (i) articulate what is required to give a definition
   of a concept; (ii) describe the reasons why there might be more than one
   way to define the concept of food
   
      Necessary conditions :
    :   what is *required* for something to be the case.
    
      Sufficient conditions :
    : what is *enough* for something to be the case.
    
      Definition : 
    : the necessary and sufficient conditions for the application of a term or concept. A proper definition should specify all and only the defined objects.
 
 - Distinguish between food as natural kind and food as social kind
 
   
   
3. A creature has moral status if it has interests, and it has interests if, and only if, it is sentient. The minimal interests of a sentient creature are pleasure and the absence of pain
