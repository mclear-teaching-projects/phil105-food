1. Explain what food insecurity is. Explain the "principle of preventing bad
   occurrences". How does Singer use this principle to argue for supporting
   the food insecure? What objections might we raise for this argument? Are
   any of these objections convincing? Defend your answer.
   
   - Food Insecurity: ::  a situation of limited or uncertain availability of
     nutritionally adequate and safe foods or limited or uncertain ability
     to acquire acceptable foods in socially acceptable ways 

   1. Available: food is available in sufficient quantities & on a
      consistent basis
   2. Accessible: people can regularly acquire adequate quantities of food
      through socially acceptable methods
   3. Utilizable: consumed food has a positive nutritional impact on people


    The Principle of Preventing Bad Occurences:
    :   if it is in our power to prevent something bad from happening,
        without thereby sacrificing anything of comparable moral importance,
        we ought, morally, to do it. (Singer, 231)

    PPBO is not affected by distance or numbers. We might worry that the principle
    is too demanding & erases distinction between moral requirements and
    supererogatory actions. One response would be to slightly weaken our
    interpretation of the principle so that we need not worry about 'comparable'
    sacrifice. 


2. The interests of the food industry are misaligned with those of public
   health. Explain this misalignment. Does the structure of the industrial
   food system present an instance of "moral hazard"? Defend your answer.

    - Food industry generates profit only by either (i) lowering costs; (ii) increasing demand
    - Push to lower costs encourges features of IFS 
    - Increasing demand requires either (i) increased processing of food; (ii) increased consumption
      Neither are obviously in the public health interest

    Moral Hazard
    :   One party engages in "risky" actions at least in part due to the
        knowledge that some other party bears the cost of those risks.
        Typically arises when one or both of the parties possesses
        incomplete information about the other (\"information asymmetry\").
    
    - The actions of the IFS seem to hinge on information asymmetries and the
    placement of risk on consumer & gov in manner similar to the tobacco
    industry


3. "Local" agriculture privileges geographic and cultural locality when making
   food consumption and production choices. Describe at least **three**
   advantages & disadvantages of each "local" and "global" form of
   agriculture. Is one form of agriculture preferable to the other? Defend
   your answer.


    - Local Advantages:
      - Reduced distance for transport of goods means lower environmental impact
      - Supports local economies
      - Promotes the continued existence of specific cultural practices or traditions
      - Promotes a connection to a particular locale or "sense of place"
      - Promotes or maintains a "sustainable community"
    - Local Disadvantages:
      - Increased cost of food
      - Increased time required for production/consumption
      - Perhaps difficult to scale (i.e. maybe not all populations can be locavores)
      - Provincial
      - For many areas localism may result in a net decrease in the variety of
        available foods
