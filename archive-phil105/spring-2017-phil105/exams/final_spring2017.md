# Argument Identification (20 points)

*Pick **two passages**. Identify (i) the main point of the passage; (ii) the
evidence or argument that supports this point*

1. 
    >human pain differs from animal pain by an order of magnitude. This
    >qualitative difference is largely the result of our possession of language
    >and, by virtue of language, our ability to have thoughts about thoughts
    >and to imagine what is not...we can draw a distinction between pain, which
    >a great many animals obviously experience, and suffering, which depends on
    >a degree of self-consciousness only a handful of animals appear to
    >command. Suffering in this view is not just lots of pain but pain
    >amplified by distinctly human emotions such as regret, self-pity, shame,
    >humiliation, and dread.
    
2. 

    >  Because giving money is regarded as an act of charity, it is not thought
    >  that there is anything wrong with not giving. The charitable man may be
    >  praised, but the man who is not charitable is not condemned. People do not
    >  feel in any way ashamed or guilty about spending money on new clothes or a
    >  new car instead of giving it to famine relief. (Indeed, the alternative does
    >  not occur to them.) This way of looking at the matter cannot be justified.
    >  When we buy new clothes not to keep ourselves warm but to look "well-dressed"
    >  we are not providing for any important need. We would not be sacrificing
    >  anything significant if we were to continue to wear our old clothes, and give
    >  the money to famine relief. By doing so, we would be preventing another
    >  person from starving. It follows from what I have said earlier that we ought
    >  to give money away, rather than spend it on clothes which we do not need to
    >  keep us warm. 


3. 

    > It is curious that, even though the cost of a ticket to the opera or to a
    > rock concert or a Broadway play is considerably more than a dinner at most
    > upscale restaurants, the attitudes toward concert-going music lovers are
    > rarely as disapproving as those toward foodies. Indeed, many people who
    > feel morally uncomfortable spending $50 or $100 for a meal, buy such
    > tickets themselves; they drive Volvos rather than Subarus or Hondas; they
    > own large flat-screen TVs. There is no reason to think that the amount of
    > money the typical foodie spends in the service of her foodieism, then, is
    > especially large, relative to other middle- and upper-class indulgences.
    > That it should be more likely to arouse moral criticism needs to be
    > explained in other ways.

# Short Essay (30 points)

*Answer only **two** of the three*

1. Explain the "principle of preventing bad occurrences". How does Singer use
   this principle to argue for famine relief? What objections might we raise
   for this argument? How might Singer respond in defense of the argument?
   
2. Explain what a genetically modified food is and Comstock's division of
   objections to it between intrinsic and extrinsic objections. Then explain
   the "unnaturalness objection". Discuss at least one reason why one might
   consider GM food unnatural. Discuss at least one problem with this
   reasoning.

3. Explain what a functional food is. Kaplan raises an objection to functional
   foods based on market forces. Describe this objection. Is the objection
   persuasive? Why or why not?
