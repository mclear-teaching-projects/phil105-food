This week we discuss issues surrounding famine, affluence, and politics. 

** Class 20 (4/3)
- Peter Singer, "[[file:{filename}/readings/singer_famine.pdf][Famine, Affluence, and Morality]]"
  - [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1970_Bhola_cyclone][Background on the 1971 Bangladesh Famine]]

** Class 21 (4/5)
- Hardin, "[[file:{filename}/readings/hardin_lifeboat.pdf][Lifeboat Ethics]]"
- Murdoch and Oaten, "[[file:{filename}/readings/murdoch_population.pdf][Population and Food]]"

** Reading Questions
- What does Singer think we are morally obliged to do if we live in a
  wealthy/industrially developed country?
- Is Singer's conception of what is morally required too demanding?
- What does Hardin mean when referring to "lifeboat" ethics?
- Why do Murdoch & Oaten think that Hardin's position is simplistic and misleading?
