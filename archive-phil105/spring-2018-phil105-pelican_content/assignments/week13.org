** Reading Questions
- What are "slow" or "deep" food systems?
- What advantage might there be to having a purely "local" food system?
  How local is "local"?
- What does Heldke mean by "food cosmopolitanism"?
- What is the intermediate position that Heldke advocates between
  cosmopolitanism and localism?
- How might localism be "elitist"?
