------

This week we continue our introduction to the ethics of eating with a look at
the way in which the industrial food system produces poultry (chicken in
particular) both for consumption and egg production. We'll also start to
discuss the different moral frameworks we might use in evaluating the moral
status of animals and the issue of killing them for food.

Here are slides for [[file:{filename}/slides/week6_poultry.pdf][poultry factory farming]] and [[file:{filename}/slides/week6_consequentialism.pdf][consequentialism]].

** Reading Questions
- How much does the intelligence of an animal matter when considering the
  ethics of killing it for food?
- Are the conditions under which chickens are raised in industrial farms cruel?
- What is anthropocentrism? What is anthropomorphism?
- Is it overly sentimental, or perhaps an anthropomorphic mistake, to worry
  about the suffering of an animal raised for food?
