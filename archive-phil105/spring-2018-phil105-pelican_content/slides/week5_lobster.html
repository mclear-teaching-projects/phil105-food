Dick — whose son-in-law happens to be a professional lobsterman and one of the
Main Eating Tent’s regular suppliers — explains what he and his family feel is
the crucial mitigating factor in the whole morality-of-boiling-lobsters-alive
issue: “There’s a part of the brain in people and animals that lets us feel
pain, and lobsters’ brains don’t have this part.” (Wallace, "Consider the Lobster")

[L]obsters do have nociceptors, as well as invertebrate versions of the prostaglandins and major neurotransmitters via which our own brains register pain.
</p>

<p>
Lobsters do not, on the other hand, appear to have the equipment for making or absorbing natural opioids like endorphins and enkephalins, which are what more advanced nervous systems use to try to handle intense pain. (Wallace, "Consider the Lobster")

There is, after all, a difference between (1) pain as a purely neurological
event, and (2) actual suffering, which seems crucially to involve an emotional
component, an awareness of pain as unpleasant, as something to
fear/dislike/want to avoid. (Wallace, "Consider the Lobster")

the lobster will sometimes try to cling to the container’s sides or even to hook its claws over the kettle’s rim <b>like a person trying to keep from going over the edge of a roof</b>. And worse is when the lobster’s fully immersed. Even if you cover the kettle and turn away, you can usually hear the cover rattling and clanking as the lobster tries to push it off. Or the creature’s claws scraping the sides of the kettle as it thrashes around. The lobster, in other words, behaves very much as you or I would behave if we were plunged into boiling water

1. A person is guilty of aggravated cruelty to animals when, with no
justifiable purpose, he or she intentionally kills or intentionally causes
serious physical injury to a <i>companion animal</i> with aggravated cruelty.  For
purposes of this section, “aggravated cruelty” shall mean conduct which:  (i)
is intended to cause extreme physical pain;  or (ii) is done or carried out in
an especially depraved or sadistic manner.  (New York Agriculture and Markets Law § 353-a. Aggravated cruelty to animals)
