* What is Food?

** Writing Exercise                                                            :noexport:

- What is one thing you want to learn in this class?
- What is one food you love to eat?
- Have you ever been a part of a food production process?    

** Definitions

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
- Necessary conditions :: what is /required/ for something to be the case.
- Sufficient conditions :: what is /enough/ for something to be the case.
- Definition :: the necessary and sufficient conditions for the
                application of a term or concept. A proper definition should
                specify all and only the defined objects.  
                
** Food & Nutrients 
- Nutrient :: a component or element of a food stuff that an organism needs in order
              to develop and/or survive
              
#+BEGIN_NOTES
- Macronutrients :: fat, water, protein, carbohydrates
- Micronutrients :: vitamins & minerals
- "Essential nutrients" are nutrients whose lack is linked to specific
  deficiency diseases (e.g. Vitamin C & scurvy)
  - Essential nutrients are unable to be synthesized internally (either at
    all, or in sufficient quantities), and so must be consumed by an organism
    from its environment
#+END_NOTES

** Food & Energy
- Calorie :: The amount of energy needed to raise the temperature of 1 kilogram of
             water 1 degree Celsius
            
#+BEGIN_NOTES
- A calories is a *unit measure*; calories aren't in a thing like nutrients are
- A calorie is ultimately a measure of digestable (burnable/metabolizable) energy
#+END_NOTES

** "Food" Defined?

- Food :: Any substance or stuff that provides calories and/or nutrients
          
#+BEGIN_NOTES
- Are there counterexamples? 
  - Not sufficient: feces is not (for humans) food; water & oxygen are not foodstuffs
  - Not necessary: cellulose (fiber more generally) is not a nutrient & has no
    calories (its indigestible) but is present in many foods
#+END_NOTES

** Natural Kinds  
- Natural Kind :: a kind, term, or sortal concept (e.g. cat, dog, mammal) that
                  corresponds to a grouping that reflects the structure of the
                  natural world rather than the interests, actions, or
                  practices of human beings 

#+BEGIN_NOTES 
- Is "food" a natural kind? Is it more like "cool" or more like "water"?
#+END_NOTES

** Social Construction
- Generic social construction :: Something is a social construction in the generic sense just in case it is an intended or unintended product of a social practice.

#+BEGIN_NOTES
  - Includes all artifacts, and much else besides
    - washing machines (artifact; causally constructed)
    - husband/wife (non-artifact; constitutively constructed)
    - professor (non-artifact; constitutively constructed)
#+END_NOTES

** Causal vs. Constitutive
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
- Causal construction :: Something is causally constructed iff social factors play a causal role in bringing it into existence or, to some substantial extent, in its being the way it is.
#+BEGIN_NOTES
- *Example*: social vs. biological causes in evaluating that someone is male/female
#+END_NOTES
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
- Constitutive construction :: Something is constitutively constructed iff in defining it we must make reference to social factors.
    
#+BEGIN_NOTES
- Explain that "iff" is if and only -- i.e. necessary and sufficient
- Can something be both causally & constitutively constructed?
#+END_NOTES

* Food as Nutrient
** Giving a Definition
- Definition :: the necessary and sufficient conditions for the
                application of a term or concept. A proper definition should
                specify all and only the defined objects.  

** Concepts & Kinds  
- Natural Kind :: a kind, term, or "sortal" concept (e.g. cat, dog, mammal) that
                  corresponds to a grouping that reflects the structure of the
                  natural world rather than the interests, actions, or
                  practices of human beings 

- Socially Constructed Kind :: Something is a socially constructed kind just in case it is an intended or unintended product of a social practice.
     - Causal vs. constitutive social construction

#+BEGIN_NOTES
  - Includes all artifacts, and much else besides
    - washing machines (artifact; causally constructed)
    - husband/wife (non-artifact; constitutively constructed)
    - professor (non-artifact; constitutively constructed)
#+END_NOTES

** Writing Exercise 
1. Give an example of a natural kind and a social kind
2. Name a feature for each example that is sufficient for its being a
   natural kind or a social kind

#+BEGIN_NOTES
- *Discussion*: Have students name examples of natural & social kinds and write them
  down on whiteboard
#+END_NOTES

** Causal vs. Constitutive Social Kinds

             kilogram of water 1 degree Celsius
- Nutrient :: a component or element of a food stuff that an organism needs in
              order to develop and/or survive

              
#+BEGIN_NOTES
- Macronutrients :: fat, water, protein, carbohydrates

\\

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Eat food. Not too much. Mostly plants.

Once, food was all you could eat, but today there are lots of other edible
foodlike substances in the supermarket
#+END_QUOTE

#+BEGIN_NOTES
- Are there counterexamples? 
  - Not sufficient: feces is not (for humans) food; water & oxygen are not foodstuffs
  - Not necessary: cellulose (fiber more generally) is not a nutrient & has no
    calories (its indigestible) but is present in many foods
- In what sense is nutritionism "ideological"?
#+END_NOTES

** Food: Natural AND Social?

- Might we use "food" in a way that is /ambiguous/ between a purely natural
  use and a purely social use?

** People Food

- Are there good reasons for denying that (other) people are food?
   

*** 1. Cannibalism is a kind of illness
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  Cannibalism/suicide are manifestations of mental illness. The mentally ill
  are not competent. Thus, because competence is a prerequisite for legitimate
  consent, Brandes did not consent. (16)
#+END_QUOTE

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
- Begs the question
  #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
  - that cannibalism is illegitimate or cannot be consented to is just what is
    up for debate

*** 2. Cannibalism will kill you
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  A popular view now seems to be that the consumption of human flesh is a
  cause of this disease [Kuru]. If this is true, it seems, we have a
  reason not to consume human flesh: namely, it will kill us. (18)
#+END_QUOTE

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
- We consume lots of things that harm us without it being morally/legally illegitimate

*** 3. Cannibalism is disgusting/outrageous 
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  The sense of general disgust that pervaded that population, the argument
  goes, and the moral outrage that accompanied this disgust, would far
  outweigh whatever meager culinary benefits might accrue by consuming the
  dead. (18-19)
#+END_QUOTE        

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
- There are lots of things that might be deemed, at a time, outrageous or
  societal harms, but a conservative stance isn't itself justification

*** 4. Cannibalism violates obligations to the dead
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  The final argument against cannibalism is an argument from obligation to the
  dead. On this view, cannibalism violates the general principle that we ought
  to respect the dead, and hence, cannibalism is morally impermissible. (19)
#+END_QUOTE

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
- In some cultures cannibalims is a form of respecting the dead (e.g. Fore
  people of Papua New Guinea)

#+BEGIN_NOTES
- Swift's satire: could Swift's story work if food were a natural kind?
- Is "meat" a social kind? 
        
#+END_NOTES


** Nutritionism as Ideology

- Ideology :: Way(s) of organizing large swaths of life and experience under a
              set of shared but unexamined assumptions
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
- Nutritionism :: An ideology that conceives of food purely in terms of nutrients consumed for the maintenance & development of the organism's bodily health

\\

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
- How could construing food as a natural kind be ideological? 

** What is wrong with Nutritionism?
  #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
1. Oversimplifies our relationship to food
   #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
   - Ignores context (i.e. is 'reductionist')
     #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
     - isolates nutrients from each other
     - isolates food from diet
     - isolates diet from culture/life
2. Assumes food is only for bodily health
3. Ignores qualitative distinctions between foods
   #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
   - no difference between, e.g., beef, chicken, fish, or tofu
   - treats 'processed' food as equivalent to 'unprocessed' or 'natural' food
4. Easily leads to abuse by economic/political interests
     

#+BEGIN_NOTES
- Is this criticism anti-science?
- How many of Pollan's criticisms depend on our current ignorance about food
  science & nutrition? 
#+END_NOTES

# #+BEGIN_QUOTE
#   [the assumption that food is relevant for bodily health] is not shared by
#   all cultures and...the experience of these other cultures suggests that,
#   paradoxically, viewing food as being about things other than bodily health —
#   like pleasure, say, or socializing — makes people no less healthy; indeed,
#   there’s some reason to believe that it may make them more healthy.
# #+END_QUOTE 
       
#+BEGIN_NOTES
- Cites the "French Paradox" that consumption of unhealthy foods makes a
  population more healthy
#+END_NOTES

** Objecting to Nutritionism vs. Food Science

- Are Pollan's worries directed at /nutritionism/ or food science more generally?

#+REVEAL: split
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
If nutritional scientists know [that focusing on isolated nutrients can
produce misleading evidence], why do they do it anyway? Because a nutrient
bias is built into the way science is done: scientists need individual
variables they can isolate. Yet even the simplest food is a hopelessly complex
thing to study ... So if you’re a nutritional scientist, you do the only thing
you can do, given the tools at your disposal: break the thing down into its
component parts and study those one by one, even if that means ignoring
complex interactions and contexts, as well as the fact that the whole may be
more than, or just different from, the sum of its parts. This is what we mean
by reductionist science. 
#+END_QUOTE

#+BEGIN_NOTES
- Is this a fair way to portray the science?
- Is science hopelessly 'reductionist'?
#+END_NOTES

** An Alternative to Nutritionism?
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
 Scientists operating with the best of intentions, using the best tools at
 their disposal, have taught us to look at food in a way that has diminished
 our pleasure in eating it while doing little or nothing to improve our
 health. Perhaps what we need now is a broader, less reductive view of what
 food is, one that is at once more ecological and cultural. What would happen,
 for example, if we were to start thinking about food as less of a thing and
 more of a relationship?
#+END_QUOTE

#+BEGIN_NOTES
- Has science really done "little or nothing" to improve our health? (e.g. FDA)
- Holist conception of food
- Food as partially defined in terms of its place in a certain kind of
  functional web
#+END_NOTES
** Food Holism
#+BEGIN_NOTES
- 'Holist' conception of food
- Food as partially defined in terms of its place in a certain kind of
  functional and social web
#+END_NOTES

- Food Holism :: We should evaluate the status of a foodstuff as *food* with
                 respect to its place in a chain of social practices, production, and consumption
                 
\\

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
- Is the foodstuff heavily processed?
- Is the foodstuff that is produced also consumed by its producers?
- Is the production of the foodstuff harmful to the environment?
- Is the production of the foodstuff heavily dependent on technological intervention?


* The Food System
** Defining Food
- Food :: Any substance or stuff that provides nutritional calories
         
\\

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
- Nutritionism :: An ideology that conceives of food purely in terms of nutrients consumed for the maintenance & development of the organism's bodily health

** The Omnivore
- Omnivore :: An animal that can obtain chemical energy and nutrients from
              materials originating from plant and animal origin
               
** The Omnivore's Dilemma 
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
 To one degree or another, the question of what to have for dinner assails
 every omnivore, and always has. When you can eat just about anything nature
 has to offer, deciding what you /should/ eat will inevitably stir anxiety,
 especially when some of the potential foods on offer are liable to sicken or
 kill you. (p. 3)
#+END_QUOTE

\\

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
- As omnivores, what should humans eat when we could, hypothetically, eat (nearly) anything? 


#+BEGIN_NOTES
- This is a /normative/ question & inherently runs against nutritionism
#+END_NOTES
  
** Follow the Food Chain
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
My premise is that like every other creature on earth, humans take part in a
food chain, and our place in that food chain, or web, determines to a
considerable extent what kind of creature we are. ... /The Omnivores Dilemma/ is
about the three principal food chains that sustain us today: the industrial,
the organic, and the hunter-gatherer. (Pollan, 6-7)
#+END_QUOTE

** The Agrarian Ideal
- Agrarianism :: a social philosophy which sees farming as a way of life,
                 valuable not only for the food and agriculture it produces,
                 but also in itself.

#+BEGIN_NOTES
- emphasis on self-sufficiency & understanding of food
- farmers as "self-made" and independent
- ideal citizens for a republic 
  - Jeffersonian ideal of an agrarian democracy
- Is it scalable?
#+END_NOTES

** Industrial Food

- Industrial Food :: Any food whose origin is so complex or obscure that it requires expert help to ascertain


#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
what exactly would an ecological detective set loose in an American
supermarket discover, were he to trace the items in his shopping cart all
the way back to the soil? ... the straightforward question "What should I
eat?" could no longer be answered without first addressing two other even
more straightforward questions: "What am I eating? And where in the world
did it come from?" (Pollan, 17)
#+END_QUOTE

** Critiquing the IFS

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
- Genealogy :: an explanation of some cultural phenomenon in terms of the way
               it came about


\\

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
- Critique by "genealogy"
  #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
  - reveals contingency of the phenomenon
  - historical causes might not justify the phenomenon with respect to relevant alternatives
- The genealogy of industrial food 
  #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
  - Where does our food come from and why should it be so?

#+BEGIN_NOTES
+ Introduce notion of genealogy as critique
+ Radical contingency of our current relationship to food production & consumption
+ Historical changes/causes of IFS do not obviously justify it with respect to
  other alternatives

- Consumes significant amounts of fossil fuels
  - High "carbon footprint"
- Makes heavy use of synthetic pesticides & fertilizers
  
#+BEGIN_NOTES
- carbon footprint is historically defined as "the total set of greenhouse gas emissions caused by an [individual, event, organisation, product] expressed as carbon dioxide equivalent."
#+END_NOTES

- 2012 (most recent farm census)
  #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
  - Total population: 314.1 million 
  - Farm population: 3.2 million (roughly 2% of population)
  - Today’s farmers produce 262% more food with 2% fewer inputs (labor, seeds,
    feed, fertilizer, etc.), compared with 1950.
  - Farm goods are shipped *globally* not locally
  
*** Monoculture

- Monoculture ::  The agricultural practice of producing or growing a single crop, plant, or livestock species, variety, or breed in a field or farming system at a time

\\

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
  - advantages include specialization & cheaper sale prices from economies
    of scale
  - disadvantages include heavy dependence on fertilizers, pesticides, and GMO
    seed, all of which have known negative "externalities"
    
#+BEGIN_NOTES
- an externality is the cost or benefit that affects a party who did not choose to incur that cost or benefit
- common crops: Corn, wheat, soybeans, cotton and rice 
#+END_NOTES

*** Commodification

- Commodity ::  an economic good or service whose demand has no qualitative
               differentiation across a market

\\

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
- Commodification :: (1) the transformation of the market for a unique,
     branded product into a market based on undifferentiated products; (2) the
     assignment of economic value to something not previously considered in
     economic terms

               
#+BEGIN_NOTES
- Explain the "fungibility" of goods
  - Fungibility is the property of a good or a commodity whose individual units are capable of mutual substitution
- All the major goods produced by IA are commodities
  - corn, soybeans, wheat, beef, chicken
- Industrial foods as those whose origins are difficult/impossible to trace
- Is there a problem with treating food as a commodity?

#+END_NOTES

** What Is A Farm?

- Farm :: Any place from which at least $1,000 of agricultural products
          were produced and sold, or normally would have been sold, during
          the census year (from [[https://www.agcensus.usda.gov/Partners/2017/2017_Census_PPT_FINAL.pdf][USDA]])

          
** "Family" vs. "Corporate" Farms
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
- A critique of the IFS should not be in terms of "corporate" vs. "family" farms
- 96.4 percent of the crop-producing farms in the U.S. are owned by families,
  and they represent 87 percent of all the agricultural value generated 

#+BEGIN_NOTES
- A family farm is owned primarily by the principal operator and his or her family members
- Non-family owned farms are defined as "those operated by cooperatives, by
  hired managers on behalf of non-operator owners, by large corporations with
  diverse ownership, and by small groups of unrelated people"
- Hasn't changed since about 1996.
#+END_NOTES

*** Industrial Fertilizer
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
- Synthesizing nitrogen via the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haber_process][Haber-Bosch process]]
- Cheap fertilizer was initially due to WWII excess
- Synthetic fertilizer made monocultural farming practices possible on a large scale
  
#+BEGIN_NOTES

- direct pay system encourages farmers to sell corn at any price
#+END_NOTES

*** Industrial Meat
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
- Inexpensive corn becomes high-energy feed for livestock
- Corn-fed cattle reach "slaughter-weight" in less than 1/3 of the time grass-fed
  cattle require
  
#+BEGIN_NOTES
- Discuss costs of cattle on corn:
  - need for antibiotics
  - factory like conditions
#+END_NOTES

*** Food Economics
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
- "Inelasticity" of demand
- Constant threat of commodification
  
#+BEGIN_NOTES
- the potential boon of falling raw material prices—which should allow you to
  sell a lot more of your product at a lower price—can't be realized in the
  case of food because of the special nature of your consumer, who can eat
  only so much food, no matter how cheap it gets. (Food industry executives
  used to call this the problem of the "fixed stomach"; economists speak of
  "inelastic demand.")

#+END_NOTES

** The Misalignment of Interests
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
- Food industry generates profit only by either (i) lowering costs; (ii) increasing demand
  #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
  - Push to lower costs encourges features of IFS 
    #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
    - Increasing demand requires either (i) increased processing of food; (ii) increased consumption
      
#+BEGIN_NOTES
- Consumers can only consume so much food without health risks
- Processed foods are not obviously healthy (Nutritionism rears its head here)
#+END_NOTES

** Food Production & Moral Hazard
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
- Moral Hazard :: One party engages in "risky" actions at least in part due to the knowledge that some other party bears the cost of those risks. Typically arises when one or both of the parties possesses incomplete information about the other ("information asymmetry").
                  
                  \\

#+BEGIN_NOTES
- Origin in insurance industry worries about actions of insured people
- Also seems to apply to tobacco industry, oil industry, and perhaps food industry
#+END_NOTES

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
- Does the food industry engage in practices that generate risks borne primarily by food consumers & government?

** Influencing Policy
- Lobbying :: any /legal/ attempt by individuals or groups to inﬂuence government policy or action (i.e. no bribery or coercive threats)

the lobster will sometimes try to cling to the container’s sides or even to hook its claws over the kettle’s rim *like a person trying to keep from going over the edge of a roof*. And worse is when the lobster’s fully immersed. Even if you cover the kettle and turn away, you can usually hear the cover rattling and clanking as the lobster tries to push it off.

 Six months of intense puppy suffering, followed by a brutal death, produced
 enough cocoamone to last Fred a week, hence the twenty-six cages. He isn’t a

 cocoamone without torturing puppies, he would gladly employ it. He derives no
 pleasure from the suffering of the puppies itself. He sympathizes with those
 who are horrified by the pain and misery of the animals, but the court must
 realize that human pleasure is at stake. The puppies, while undeniably cute,
 are mere animals. He admits that he would be just as healthy without
 chocolate, if not more so. But this isn’t a matter of survival or health. His
 life would be unacceptably impoverished without the experience of
 chocolate. (Norcross, 230)

 if I did not buy and consume factory-raised meat, no animals would be spared

 well regret the suffering inflicted on animals for the sake of human
 enjoyment. I may even agree that the human enjoyment doesn’t justify the
 suffering. However, since the animals will suffer no matter what I do, I may
 as well enjoy the taste of their flesh. (Norcross, 231)

 Fred acts impermissibly, according to this line of argument, because he

 not intend the suffering. (Norcross, 234)
#+END_QUOTE

1. The Doctrine of Double Effect requires not merely that a bad effect be
   foreseen and not intended, but also that there be an outweighing good
   effect, and there no such good effect in the case of factory farming
2. Fred's behavior would be bad even if it accorded with the DoDE
   
#+BEGIN_NOTES
- Concerning (2) Fred's story is easily modified to render the puppies’ suffering ‘merely’ foreseen. For example, suppose that the cocoamone is produced by a chemical reaction that can only occur when large quantities of drain-cleaner are forced down the throat of a conscious, unanaesthetized puppy. The consequent appalling suffering, while not itself a means to the production of cocoamone, is nonetheless an unavoidable side-effect of the means. In this variation of the story, Fred’s behavior is no less abominable than in the original.

** Acting Autonomously

- Autonomy :: the property of being self-governing, and hence of being able to
              engage in actions and patterns of evaluation that are under

  as rules which all share the same characteristic -- /universality/

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
 man and generally any rational being exists as an end in himself, not merely
 as a means to be arbitrarily used by this or that will, and in all his
 actions, whether they concern himself or other rational beings, must be
 always regarded at the same time as an end [and not merely as a means].
 (Kant, p. 4)
#+END_QUOTE

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
- Only rational beings have moral status because only rational beings are
  intrinsically valuable
** Kant on Duties to Animals
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
 Our duties towards animals are merely indirect duties towards humanity...If a man shoots his dog because the animal is no longer capable of service, he does not fail in his duty to the dog, for the dog cannot judge, but his /act is inhuman and damages in himself that humanity which it is his duty to show towards mankind/. If he is not to stifle his human feelings, he must practice kindness towards animals, for he who is cruel to animals becomes hard also in his dealing with men.
#+END_QUOTE

** Are Animals Things?
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
 Those beings whose existence rests not on our will but on nature, if they are
 non-rational beings, have still only a relative worth, as means, and are
 therefore called /things/, while rational beings, on the contrary, are called
 /persons/, because their nature already distinguishes them as ends in
 themselves, i.e. as something that may not be used merely as a means, hence
 to this extent limits all arbitrariness (and is an object of respect). (Kant,
 Groundwork 4:428)

*** The Value of Animal Nature

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
As animals, we are beings for whom things can be good or bad: that is just a natural fact. When we demand to be treated as ends in ourselves, we confer normative significance on that fact. We legislate that the things that are good or bad for beings for whom things can be good or bad-that is, for animals-should be treated as /good or bad objectively and normatively/. In other words, we legislate that animals are to be treated as ends in themselves. And that is why we have duties to the other animals.

* Deontology Applied
** Animals & Indirect Duty Views
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
 some people believe that we have no duties directly to animals—that we owe
 nothing to them—that we can do nothing that wrongs them. Rather, we can do
 wrong acts that involve animals, and so we have duties regarding them, though
 none to them. Such views may be called indirect duty views. (Regan, 32)
#+END_QUOTE

** Animal Rights
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
 The fundamental wrong is the system that allows us to view animals as our
 resources, here for us—to be eaten, or surgically manipulated, or put in our
 cross hairs for sport or money. (Regan, 31)
#+END_QUOTE

#+BEGIN_NOTES
- animals as "resources" means viewing merely as means
- aims for dissolution of commercial agriculture & commercial/sport hunting/trapping
- presumably also would eliminate animal testing
#+END_NOTES

** The Problem with Indirect Duty Views
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
- Views that allow only indirect duties to animals locate moral status in the
  wrong place
  #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
  - We can see the problem of locating moral status by looking at marginal
    cases

*** The Problem of Marginal Cases
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
1. Animals lack moral status, and so cannot be the direct or independent
   objects of moral consideration [indirect duty view]
2. Animals lack moral status because they are unable to /F/ (e.g. unable to act rationally)
3. But there are cases of beings of the kind that possesses moral status (e.g.
   human beings) that are unable to /F/ (e.g. children, mentally disabled)
4. There are no other relevant differences between these marginal cases and animals
5. Since we can't treat children or the disabled like things, we can't treat
   animals like things either -- i.e. animals have moral status
6. \therefore We have direct duties towards animals

** Against Utilitarianism

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
 Here is an analogy to help make the philosophical point clearer: a cup
 contains different liquids—sometimes sweet, sometimes bitter, sometimes a mix
 of the two. What has value are the liquids: the sweeter the better, the
 bitter the worse. The cup—the container—has no value. It’s what goes into
 it, not what they go into, that has value. For the utilitarian, you and I are
 like the cup; we have no value as individuals and thus no equal value. What
 has value is what goes into us, what we serve as receptacles for; our
 feelings of satisfaction have positive value, our feelings of frustration
 have negative value. (Regan, 35)
#+END_QUOTE

** The Rights View
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
 you and I, for example, do have value as individuals—what we’ll call
 /inherent value/ ... My value as an individual is independent of my
 usefulness to you. Yours is not dependent on your usefulness to me. For
 either of us to treat the other in ways that fail to show respect for the
 other’s independent value is to act immorally—is to violate the individual’s
 rights. (Regan, 36)
#+END_QUOTE

*** Having Rights
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
- What does it take to have value as an individual---to have rights?
  #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
  - Inherent value belongs equally to any who are the "experiencing subjects
    of a life" (Regan, 37)
  - At least some animals are such experiencing subjects, so at least some
    animals have rights---they cannot be used merely as means to another's ends

** Warren's Objection
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  (1) it [Regan's animal rights theory] rests upon the obscure concept of
  inherent value, which is defined only in negative terms, and (2) it seems to
  preclude any plausible answer to questions about the moral status of the
  vast majority of sentient animals
#+END_QUOTE

#+BEGIN_NOTES
- It is difficult to understand what inherent value is
  - "It is not dependent upon the value which either the inherently valuable
    individual or anyone else may place upon that individual's life or
    experiences. It is not (necessarily) a function of sentience or any other
    mental capacity"
- Hard to identify any sharp line distinguishing those which have it from
  those that don't (doesn't "subjecthood" come in degrees?)
#+END_NOTES

** Replies to Warren

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
- The problem with inherent value isn't that it is mysterious, but rather
  that Regan hasn't provided a satisfactory explanation of /why/ animals
  have inherent value
- The fact that our knowledge of which beings have inherent value is
  limited doesn't mean that we shouldn't be cautious in the manner in
  which we make life or death decisions regarding their treatment

 it seems to me [the vegetarian] has lost something along the way,
 something I'm not prepared to dismiss as trivial. Healthy and virtuous
 as I may feel these days, I also feel alienated from traditions I
 value: cultural traditions like the Thanksgiving turkey, or even franks
 at the ballpark, and family traditions like my mother's beef brisket at
 Passover. These ritual meals link us to our history along multiple
 lines---family, religion, landscape, nation, and, if you want to go back
 much further, biology. For although humans no longer need meat in order
 to survive...we have been meat eaters for most of our time on earth.
 This fact of evolutionary history is reflected in [our physiology]. (OD, 314)

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)

  human pain differs from animal pain by an order of magnitude. This
  qualitative difference is largely the result of our possession of
  language and, by virtue of language, our ability to have thoughts
  about thoughts and to imagine what is not...we can draw a distinction
  between pain, which a great many animals obviously experience, and
  suffering, which depends on a degree of self-consciousness only a
  handful of animals appear to command. Suffering in this view is not
  just lots of pain but pain amplified by distinctly human emotions such
  as regret, self-pity, shame, humiliation, and dread. (OD, 316)

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
- While it might be true that a /certain kind/ of suffering requires
  language, it isn't obvious that /suffering/ as such does
- Cognitively unsophisticated creatures might actually suffer /more/,
  since they cannot understand the purpose of many pain-inducing
  activities
- Even allowing the distinction, industrial farming practices clearly
  generate prolonged pain that clearly goes against the interests of the
  animals produced by it

 We can take Pollan to be arguing that since domestic animals have
 evolved to be what they now are through their symbiotic relationship
 with humans, their "characteristic form of life"---a phrase Pollan
 borrows from Aristotle---is one lived in domestication with humans, and
 that means---for chickens, pigs, cows, and sheep---a life on a farm or
 ranch. This is their nature, and the Good Life for them is one in which
 they can live, in accordance with their nature, on the Good Farm, until
 they are killed and eaten. The killing and eating is unavoidable, for
 without it neither farms, nor the animals on them, would exist at all.

 cattle, like all the animals we eat, died while still very young. They might have lived several more years before meeting one of these other forms of death, years in which they matured, experienced sexual intercourse, and, if they were females, cared for their children. We humans, after all, are prepared to pass up many rapid and humane forms of death in order to live a few more years, even if we are then likely to die of a disease that causes us to suffer before we die.

 harvest whatever animals that would eat our crops we exterminate.
 Killing animals is probably unavoidable no matter what we choose to

 probably try to eat the largest possible animal that can live on the
 least cultivated land: grass-finished steaks for everyone. (OD, 326)

 Because giving money is regarded as an act of charity, it is not
 thought that there is anything wrong with not giving. The charitable
 man may be praised, but the man who is not charitable is not condemned.
 People do not feel in any way ashamed or guilty about spending money on
 new clothes or a new car instead of giving it to famine relief.
 (Indeed, the alternative does not occur to them.) This way of looking
 at the matter cannot be justified. When we buy new clothes not to keep
 ourselves warm but to look "well-dressed" we are not providing for any
 important need. We would not be sacrificing anything significant if we
 were to continue to wear our old clothes, and give the money to famine
 relief. By doing so, we would be preventing another person from
 starving. It follows from what I have said earlier that we ought to
 give money away, rather than spend it on clothes which we do not need

animals must perform a variety of functions to build muscle mass: They must
digest food, circulate nutrients and oxygen, maintain an optimal body
temperature, and protect against disease. Food energy fuels these processes in
organisms, but carneries will have to use industrial energy, i.e. fossil
fuels, to accomplish the same tasks. For example, unlike animals, meat grown
in a factory will not have an immune system. That means everything that
touches it must be sterilized to avoid contamination with harmful microbes.
Both heating water and using chemicals for sterilization could require a great

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
- Appreciation of art & nature modeled on "alimentary" experience of food

\\
  
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
 The external sense of taste...with which nature has furnished us, and by
 which we distinguish and relish the various kinds of nourishment that are
 adapted to health and pleasure, has in all languages given occasion to
 the metaphorical word /taste/, by which we express our perception of
 beauty, deformity, or defect, in the several arts. (Voltaire, /An Essay on
 Taste/)
#+END_QUOTE

** Three Features of Taste
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
- Hedonically judgmental: :: we naturally evaluate what we ingest by
     means of a response of pleasure or displeasure
- Immediate: :: responses of pleasure/displeasure are made without further
                reflection or judgment
- Directly Sensory :: critical judgments must depend on one's own experience 

     
*** Some Consequences of the View of Taste
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
- It isn't clear on this picture that there can be genuine disputes about taste
- Threat of relativism 
- Could there even /be/ a refined or "critical" taste?

** Kant's Criticism of Aesthetics as Taste
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
- Kant argues that we must distinguish the subjective notion of being
  "agreeable" with the objective and aesthetic notion of being "beautiful"

  \\

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
 Many things may be charming and agreeable to him; no one cares about
 that. But if he proclaims something to be beautiful, then he requires the
 same liking from others; he then judges not just for himself but for
 everyone, and speaks of beauty as if it were a property of things. (Kant,
 /Critique of Judgment/)
#+END_QUOTE

*** Distinguishing the Subjective from the Objective
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
- Kant distinguishes a subjective "taste of sense" with an objective
  "taste of reflection"
  #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
  - Taste of sense: :: immediate and subjective (pleasurable or
       displeasurable) impression of some thing
  - Taste of reflection: :: contemplative enjoyment of something
       independent of whether it causes a pleasurable/displeasurable
       feeling in oneself---i.e. one has a /disinterested/ enjoyment of
       the thing
       
*** Kant Against An Aesthetic Appreciation of Food
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
 Kant points out that we have individual, and at times quirky, likes
 and dislikes of particular foods. We sense liking or disliking a soup,
 for instance, immediately on tasting it, and our appreciative attitude
 towards food is one of a “taste of sense.” However, our attitude
 towards things beautiful is quite different. To value something as
 beautiful, Kant thought, demanded a universal assent and should not be
 based on a personal preference. Appreciation of the beautiful calls for
 our exhibiting a disinterested attitude. Our enjoyment of things
 beautiful is not a hedonic reﬂex. It requires a taste of reﬂection, a
 sustained contemplative activity, one which engages our common
 cognitive faculties, especially our imagination, in an unrestricted
 way. (Sweeney, 122)
#+END_QUOTE

#+REVEAL: split
1. Our appreciation of food at best involves a mere taste of
   sense---i.e. mere personal preference
2. Appreciation of aesthetic properties requires a taste of
   reflection---i.e. taking a disinterested pleasure in something and
   thinking that others should do so as well
3. \therefore Food is not a proper object of aesthetic appreciation/criticism
   
** Sweeney's Argument for the Aesthetic Qualitites of Food 
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
 we can answer the question “Can a soup be beautiful?” in the affirmative
 because a soup can be the object of a complex aesthetic experience that
 warrants an evaluative label like ‘beautiful.’ Unlike those who hold that
 food offers only an immediate simple pleasure, we...now recognize that
 food offers us a contemplative experience, because of the alimentary
 sequence by which it is consumed and the sensory modalities of taste and
 smell with which it is engaged. (Sweeney, 129)
#+END_QUOTE

#+REVEAL: split
1. The Kantian conception of aesthetic judgment requires that it be
   reflective/contemplative and disinterested
2. Alimentary experience is sufficiently complex as to allow for
   reflective and disinterested judgment
3. \therefore Food, as the object of such experience, can be a genuine object of
   aesthetic appreciation
