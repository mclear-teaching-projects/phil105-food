<blockquote nil>
<p>
If nutritional scientists know [that focusing on isolated nutrients can
produce misleading evidence], why do they do it anyway? Because a nutrient
bias is built into the way science is done: scientists need individual
variables they can isolate. Yet even the simplest food is a hopelessly complex
thing to study &#x2026; So if you’re a nutritional scientist, you do the only thing
you can do, given the tools at your disposal: break the thing down into its
component parts and study those one by one, even if that means ignoring
complex interactions and contexts, as well as the fact that the whole may be
more than, or just different from, the sum of its parts. This is what we mean
by reductionist science.

<h3 id="org2dbcba0">An Alternative to Nutritionism?</h3>
<blockquote nil>
<p>
Scientists operating with the best of intentions, using the best tools at
their disposal, have taught us to look at food in a way that has diminished
our pleasure in eating it while doing little or nothing to improve our
health. Perhaps what we need now is a broader, less reductive view of what
food is, one that is at once more ecological and cultural. What would happen,
for example, if we were to start thinking about food as less of a thing and
more of a relationship?
