man and generally any rational being exists as an end in himself, not merely
as a means to be arbitrarily used by this or that will, and in all his
actions, whether they concern himself or other rational beings, must be
always regarded at the same time as an end [and not merely as a means].

<blockquote nil>
<p>
Our duties towards animals are merely indirect duties towards humanity&#x2026;If a man shoots his dog because the animal is no longer capable of service, he does not fail in his duty to the dog, for the dog cannot judge, but his <i>act is inhuman and damages in himself that humanity which it is his duty to show towards mankind</i>. If he is not to stifle his human feelings, he must practice kindness towards animals, for he who is cruel to animals becomes hard also in his dealing with men.

<blockquote nil>
<p>
Those beings whose existence rests not on our will but on nature, if they are
non-rational beings, have still only a relative worth, as means, and are
therefore called <i>things</i>, while rational beings, on the contrary, are called
<i>persons</i>, because their nature already distinguishes them as ends in
themselves, i.e. as something that may not be used merely as a means, hence
to this extent limits all arbitrariness (and is an object of respect). (Kant,
Groundwork 4:428)

<blockquote nil>
<p>
As animals, we are beings for whom things can be good or bad: that is just a natural fact. When we demand to be treated as ends in ourselves, we confer normative significance on that fact. We legislate that the things that are good or bad for beings for whom things can be good or bad-that is, for animals-should be treated as <i>good or bad objectively and normatively</i>. In other words, we legislate that animals are to be treated as ends in themselves. And that is why we have duties to the other animals.
